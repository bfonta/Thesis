Out of the four known fundamental forces, three are described by the \ac{SM}: the electromagnetic, the weak and the strong forces.
Electromagnetism is responsible for most natural phenomena we can readily perceive, such as friction, elasticity or drag, the color of the sky and how that changes during sun-sets, from high-speed Maglev trains to impressive lightning storms.
The weak force is related to particle decays, and is fundamental for the nuclear fusion reactions that power the Sun.
Finally, the strong force is what keeps atoms and hadrons together.
The gravitational force is not integrated within the \ac{SM}, but it is by far the weakest of all forces, and can be safely neglected at the subatomic scales here discussed.

The three forces are represented by a \symfull{} local gauge symmetry, which is obeyed by the full \ac{SM} lagrangian.
The \symcolor{} group is generated by the mediators of the strong force, the gluons, described by \ac{QCD}.
On the other hand, the \symweak{} symmetry encompasses both the weak and electromagnetic forces, respectively mediated by the W and Z vector bosons, and by the photons $\gamma$.
Particles are categorized according to their spin, being called bosons when possessing integer spin, and called fermions when the spin is half-integer.
All mediators are bosons, and 12 exist in the \ac{SM}: 8 gluons plus the four just mentioned.
Fermions, instead, comprise all ordinary matter and are exchanged by the mediators, being subdivided into quarks and leptons.
Twelve different fermionic fields are defined in the \ac{SM}, where half of those correspond to identical particles with opposite quantum numbers, \ie{} antiparticles.
Quarks and leptons are split across generations, where each generation comprises either two quarks with electric charges $2/3$ and $-1/3$, or two leptons with charges $-1$ and $0$:

#+NAME: eq:quarks_and_leptons
\begin{equation}
\text{leptons:} \:\: \binom{\nu_{e}}{e} \: \binom{\nu_{\mu}}{\mu} \: \binom{\nu_{\tau}}{\tau} \: , \:\:\:\:\:\: \text{quarks:} \:\: \binom{u}{d} \: \binom{c}{s} \: \binom{t}{b}
\end{equation}

\noindent where each generation is arranged in a doublet, for reasons made clear when discussing the electroweak interaction.
The $e$, $\mu$ and $\tau$ symbols for charged leptons refer to, respectively, electrons, muons and taus.
They are identical except for their masses, which span multiple orders of magnitude: $m_{e}\approx511\,\si{\keV}$ cite:&electron_mass, $m_{\mu} \approx 105.7 \,\si{\MeV}$ cite:&electron_mass and $m_{\tau} \approx 1.8\,\si{\GeV}$ [[cite:&PDG]].
Contrary to electrons and muons, the tau lepton decays too fast for it to be observed at a collider experiment; we thus measure its decay products, which can be either leptons or hadrons, and covered in depth in [[#sec:physics_objects]].
The symbols $\nu_{e/\mu/\tau}$ refer instead to neutrinos and its three flavours, associated to the three leptons we just introduced.
Neutrinos do not have electric charge, have a very small mass, and thus interact solely via the weak force, being extremely hard to detect due to their tiny cross sections.
The current most precise estimations for their masses set them at $< 0.8\,\si{\eV}$ [[cite:&katrin_neutrinos]], $< 0.17\,\si{\MeV}$ [[cite:&assamagan_neutrinos]], and $< 18.2\,\si{\MeV}$, for $\nu_{e}$, $\nu_{\mu}$ and $\nu_{\tau}$, respectively, but their sum is constrained to $\lesssim 0.15\,\si{\eV}$ [[cite:&PDG]].
Is is however important to note that the three masses do not correspond to the three flavours, as they mix via the PMNS matrix [[cite:&pmns]], leading to neutrino oscillations [[cite:&kamiokanade_neutrinos]].
All leptons interact via the electromagnetic and weak forces, not possessing color charge.
Concerning quarks (up, down, charm, strange, top and bottom), they "feel" the three forces in the \ac{SM}, and are the internal constituents of hadrons: groups of two quarks are called mesons, groups of three are called baryons.
Due to the \ac{QCD} property of confinement, quarks cannot exist independently, and must be associated to other quarks, forming color-neutral bound states.
This includes protons and neutrons, which are made of up and down quarks in different proportions.
Hadrons with even more quarks have been observed, being all unstable.
Only the top quark cannot be part of hadrons, as it decays faster ($\tau_{t} \approx 0.5 \times 10^{-24}\,\si{\second}$ [[cite:&top_lifetime]]) than the time required to form a strong bound state.
Finally, thanks to a mechanism detailed in [[#sec:higgs_mechanism]], the scalar Higgs boson completes the collection of \ac{SM} particles, being responsible for all their masses.
The full "particle zoo" just described is illustrated in [[fig:sm_particles]], where antiparticles are not represented for simplicity.

\myparagraph{Yang-Mills theory}

\noindent In the \ac{SM}, interactions are dictated by symmetry principles [[cite:&halzen_martin]], which were initially considered at a global level, \ie{} without depending on space-time points $x$.
Yang and Mills considered instead local transformations, starting from the Dirac lagrangian for two elementary half-integer spin fields $\psi$:

#+NAME: eq:ew_lagrangian
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L} = i \bar{\psi}(x) \slashed{\partial} \psi(x) \: , \:\:\: \slashed{\partial} \equiv \gamma^{\mu}\partial_{\mu}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\psi$ is a two-component column vector, or spinor, and $\gamma^{\mu}$ are the Dirac $\gamma$ matrices.
For simplicity, we here consider massless fields (we drop the term $-m\bar{\psi}\psi$), without loss of generality.
The original Yang-Mills theory required the fields to be invariant under a local non-Abelian \symtwo{} transformation:

#+NAME: eq:su2_transf
\begin{equation}
\psi(x) \rightarrow e^{-ig\pmb{\sigma}.\pmb{\lambda}(x)}\psi(x) \:; \:\:\:
\sigma_{1} = \begin{pmatrix}
  0 & 1 \\
  1 & 0
\end{pmatrix} \: , \:\:
\sigma_{2} = \begin{pmatrix}
  0 & -i \\
  i & 0
\end{pmatrix} \: , \:\:
\sigma_{3} = \begin{pmatrix}
  1 & 0 \\
  0 & -1
\end{pmatrix} \:\: ,
\end{equation}

\noindent where the matrixes $\pmb{\sigma}$ are the Pauli matrices, $\pmb{\lambda}(x)$ is a vector of space-time-dependent scalars, and $g$ is a coupling constant analogous to the electric charge.
Without further changes, the lagrangian in [[eq:ew_lagrangian]] is not invariant to the local transformation, since the derivative picks up an extra term:

#+NAME: eq:derivative_extra
\begin{equation}
\partial_{\mu}\psi(x) \rightarrow e^{-ig\pmb{\sigma}.\pmb{\lambda}(x)} \left[ \partial_{\mu} + i\pmb{\sigma}.\partial{}_{\mu}\pmb{\lambda}(x) \right] \psi(x)
\end{equation}

\noindent If we really insist on the concept of local invariance, something has to be added to the lagrangian in order to cancel the new term in [[eq:derivative_extra]].
This can be achieved by replacing the standard derivate $\partial_{\mu}$ by the /covariant derivative/:

#+NAME: eq:covariant_derivative
\begin{equation}
D_{\mu} \equiv \partial_{\mu} + ig\pmb{\sigma}.\pmb{A}_{\mu}
\end{equation}

\noindent where a new set of /gauge fields/ $\pmb{A}_{\mu} = (A_{\mu}^{1}, A_{\mu}^{2}, A_{\mu}^{3})$ had to be introduced.
It is highly non-trivial to find the transformation rule for $\pmb{A}_{\mu}$ that restores local \symtwo{} invariance to the lagrangian, but it does exist.
Keeping only the first-order terms for the case of small $\pmb{\lambda}$, the solution is [[cite:&griffiths]]:

#+NAME: eq:gauge_transf_field
\begin{equation}
\pmb{A}_{\mu} \rightarrow \pmb{A}_{\mu} + \partial_{\mu}\pmb{\lambda} - 2g(\pmb{\lambda} \times \pmb{A}_{\mu}) \: .
\end{equation}

\noindent Finally, without forgeting the additional kinematic term brought by the new field, written as:

#+NAME: eq:kin_term
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}_{\text{Kin}} = -\frac{1}{4} F_{\mu\nu} F^{\mu\nu} \: , \:\:\: F_{\mu\nu} \equiv \partial_{\mu}A_{\nu} - \partial_{\nu}A_{\mu} - ig[A_{\mu},A_{\nu}]
\end{equation}

\noindent the new, local invariant lagrangian becomes:

#+NAME: eq:ew_lagrangian
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L} = -\frac{1}{4} F_{\mu\nu} F^{\mu\nu} + i \bar{\psi}(x) \slashed{D} \psi(x) \: , \:\:\: \slashed{D} \equiv \gamma^{\mu}D_{\mu} \:\: ,
\end{equation}

\noindent where one should notice that the new gauge fields $A_{\mu}$ couple to the particle fields $\psi$ via the covariant derivative, introducing interactions that become relevant in the context of the \ac{SM}.
As a term of the form $A_{k}A^{k}$ is not invariant under the gauge transformation in [[eq:gauge_transf_field]], the new fields must be massless, otherwise the symmetry in [[eq:ew_lagrangian]] is lost.
Crucially, it was the insistence on satisfying local gauge invariance which led to three new vector gauge fields.

The original Yang-Mills theory turned out to be of little use, since it started from the premises that there are two elementary half-integer spin particles with exactly the same mass, which were never observed.
The same idea can however be generalized to many other non-abelian symmetry groups, and ended up representing the basis of the \symcolor{} color symmetry for strong interactions and isospin-hypercharge \symweak{} for weak interactions.

\myparagraph{Chromodynamics}

\noindent According to the \ac{SM}, each quark flavour comes in three colors: red, blue and green.
Focusing on a particular flavour, we can express its free lagrangian exactly as in [[eq:ew_lagrangian]], but where now the fields are a three-component column vector $\bar{\psi} \equiv (\bar{\psi}_{r} \bar{\psi}_{b} \bar{\psi}_{g})$ for the three colors.
The lagrangian naturally exhibits a global \symthree{} symmetry, which we again make local.
Under the \symthreec{} the fields transform as follows (compare to [[eq:su2_transf]]):

#+NAME: eq:su3_transf
\begin{equation}
\psi(x) \rightarrow e^{-ig\pmb{\phi}.\pmb{\theta}}\psi(x)
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\pmb{\phi}$ represents the eight generators of \symthreec{}, also know as Gell-Mann matrices.
As in [[eq:derivative_extra]], a covariant derivative is introduced to satisfy the local invariance request, which this time will include 8 gauge fields instead of three.
The gauge fields also transform in a more complex way, due to the larger number of generators:

#+NAME: eq:gauge_transf_su3
\begin{equation}
\pmb{A}_{\mu} \rightarrow \pmb{A}_{\mu} + \partial_{\mu}\pmb{\phi} - 2g(\pmb{\phi} \times \pmb{A}_{\mu}) \: , \:\:\: (\pmb{\phi} \times \pmb{A}_{\mu})_{i} = \sum_{j,k=1}^{8}f^{ijk}\phi^{j}A_{\mu}^{k} \: ,
\end{equation}

\noindent where the $f^{ijk}$ symbols denote the structure constants of \symthreec{}, defined based on the following commutation rules:

#+NAME: eq:comm_rules
\begin{equation}
\left[ \frac{\phi^{i}}{2}, \frac{\phi^{j}}{2} \right] = if^{ijk}\frac{\phi^{k}}{2} \: .
\end{equation}

\noindent Adding the gluon kinetic term, we obtain the complete \ac{QCD} lagrangian for massless fields:

#+NAME: eq:lagrangian_qcd
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}_{\text{QCD}} = i\bar{\psi}\slashed{\partial}\psi - \frac{1}{16\pi} \pmb{F}^{\mu\nu}\pmb{F}_{\mu\nu} - g\bar{\psi}\gamma^{\mu}\pmb{\lambda}\psi\pmb{A}_{\mu} \: ,
\end{equation}

\noindent where:

#+NAME: eq:kinematic_qcd
\begin{equation}
F^{i}_{\mu\nu} = \partial_{\mu}A^{i}_{\nu} - \partial_{\mu}A^{i}_{\nu} + gf^{ijk}A^{j}_{\mu}A^{k}_{\nu} \: .
\end{equation}

\noindent The lagrangian is invariant under local \symthreec{}, describing three fields interacting with eight massless vector fields, the gluons.
Contrary to the Yang-Mills theory discussed above, scientists [[eq:lagrangian_qcd]] actually reproduces Nature's behaviour, describing the strong interaction.
The strength of the interaction is parametrized by $g$, which is usually redefined as $\alpha_{\text{S}} = g^2 /4\pi$, the strong coupling. 
Notice that, once more, the gluons must be massless for the invariance to hold.
The second term in [[eq:lagrangian_qcd]] will lead to multiple combinations in $A^{i}_{\mu}$, originating cubic and quartic interactions between gluons.

\myparagraph{The Weinberg-Salam Model}

\noindent In 1956, and against most expectations, Wu observed parity violation using the beta decay of $\text{Co}^{60}$ [[cite:&wu_experiment]].
This motivated the exploration of chiral theories, where left and right handed components behave differently under applied symmetries.
Just as \ac{QED} had be obtained by imposing a \symone{} electromagnetic local gauge invariance, it was postulated that the electromagnetic and weak forces could be united into a single force by imposing invariance under a \symweak{} transformation.
Under the latter, fermion fields of left chirality are represented as doublets, while right chirality fermions are singlets.
Dirac spinors can be decomposed into left- and right-handed chiral components L and R:

#+NAME: eq:chiral_components
\begin{equation}
\Psi_{\text{L}} = \frac{1}{2} \left( 1+\gamma^{5} \right) \binom{\psi}{\psi^{\prime}} = \binom{\psi_{\text{L}}}{\psi_{\text{L}}^{\prime}} \: , \:\:\: \psi_{\text{R}} = \frac{1}{2}(1-\gamma^{5}) \psi \: , \:\:\: \psi_{\text{R}}^{\prime} = \frac{1}{2}(1-\gamma^{5}) \psi^{\prime} \:,
\end{equation}

\noindent with the $\gamma^{5}$ matrix is defined as:

#+NAME: eq:gamma_five
\begin{equation}
\begin{pmatrix}
  0_{2 \times 2} & \mathbb{I}_{2 \times 2} \\
  \mathbb{I}_{2 \times 2} & 0_{2 \times 2}
\end{pmatrix} \: .
\end{equation}

\noindent With the notation above, the lagrangian can be written as:

#+NAME: eq:lagrangian_covariants
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}_{\text{EW}} = \bar{\Psi}_{\text{L}}(i\slashed{D})\Psi_{\text{L}} +i\bar{\psi}_{\text{R}}\slashed{D}\psi_{\text{R}} + i\bar{\psi}^{\prime}_{\text{R}}\slashed{D}\psi_{\text{R}}^{\prime} \: ,
\end{equation}

\noindent where it becomes clear the generators of \symtwol{} are zero for the right singlets, and thus only the left chirality fields interacts with the W gauge bosons.
This corresponds to Wu's observation mentioned above, where Nature does not treat left- and right-handed particles equally.
If we follow the Yang-Mills approach as in [[eq:derivative_extra]], but for the electroweak \symtwol{} transformation instead, the covariant derivative becomes:

#+NAME: eq:ew_covariant
\begin{equation}
D_{\mu} \equiv \partial_{\mu} + ig\pmb{T}\pmb{W}_{\mu} - ig^{\prime}\frac{\mathcal{Y}}{2}B_{\mu}
\end{equation}

\noindent with $T_{i} \equiv \sigma_{i}/2$ representing \symtwo{} generators given by [[eq:su2_transf]] for the left field, and 0 for the right fields, and $\mathcal{Y}$ standing for the generator of the \symoney{}, the hypercharge, which is divided by two for convention.
Rewriting [[eq:ew_lagrangian_short]] we obtain:

#+NAME: eq:ew_lagrangian_short
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}_{\text{EW}} = \mathcal{L}_{\text{F-kin.}} + \mathcal{L}_{\text{B-kin.}} + \mathcal{L}_{\text{CC}} + \mathcal{L}_{\text{NC}}
\end{equation}

\noindent where two kinematic terms are present, for the fermions and for the bosons, and interactions are encoded in the neutral and charged current terms, NC and CC, respectively.
The kinematic terms describe the propagation of fermions and gauge bosons through space-time, and are given by:

#+NAME: eq:ew_lagrangian_long_kin
\begin{align}
\mathcal{L}_{\text{F-kin.}} & = \bar{\Psi}_{\text{L}}(i\slashed{\partial})\Psi_{\text{L}} +\bar{\psi}_{\text{R}}(i\slashed{\partial})\psi_{\text{R}} + \bar{\psi}^{\prime}_{\text{R}}(i\slashed{\partial})\psi_{\text{R}}^{\prime} \:, \\[0.5em]
\mathcal{L}_{\text{B-kin.}} & = -\frac{1}{4}B_{\mu\nu}B^{\mu\nu} -\frac{1}{4}W^{i}_{\mu\nu}W_{i}^{\mu\nu}  \:,
\end{align}

\noindent The charged interactions are expressed as:

#+NAME: eq:ew_lagrangian_long_cc
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}_{\text{CC}} = \frac{g}{\sqrt{2}}W_\mu^{+}+\bar{\Psi}_{\text{L}}\gamma^\mu\sigma^+\Psi_{\text{L}}+\frac{g}{\sqrt{2}}W^-_\mu\bar{\Psi}_{\text{L}}\gamma^\mu\sigma^-\Psi_{\text{L}} = \frac{g}{\sqrt{2}}W^+\left(\bar{\psi}_{\text{L}}\gamma^\mu\psi_{\text{L}}^{\prime} \right) + \frac{g}{\sqrt{2}}W^-\left(\bar{\psi}^{\prime}_{\text{L}}\gamma^\mu\psi_{\text{L}}\right)  \:,
\end{equation}

\noindent where the interactions are reinterpreted as two charged currents by linearly combining the two gauge bosons, forming two new massive bosons corresponding to the observed \ac{SM} positive and negative W fields:

#+NAME: eq:physical_w
\begin{equation}
W_{\mu}^{\pm} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left( W_{\mu}^{1} \mp W_{\mu}^{2} \right) \: ,
\end{equation}

\noindent Finally, the term referring to neutral interactions is given by:

#+NAME: eq:ew_lagrangian_long_nc
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}_{\text{NC}} = \frac{g}{\sqrt{2}}W^3_\mu\left[\bar{\psi}_{\text{L}}\gamma^\mu\psi_{\text{L}} - \bar{\psi}^{\prime}_{\text{L}}\gamma^\mu\psi_{\text{L}}^\prime\right] + \frac{g^\prime}{\sqrt{2}}\mathcal{Y}B_\mu \bar{\Psi} \gamma^{\mu} \Psi \:.
\end{equation}

\noindent If a rotation with the /Weinberg angle/ $\theta_{\text{W}}$ is performed in the space of the two neutral gauge fields $W_{\mu}^{3}$ and $B_{\mu}$, one can recover the two gauge bosons observed in nature:

#+NAME: eq:physical_b
\begin{equation}
\binom{A_{\mu}}{Z_{\mu}} = \begin{pmatrix}\cos\theta_{\text{W}} & \sin\theta_{\text{W}} \\
                                        - \sin\theta_{\text{W}} & \cos\theta_{\text{W}}
                       \end{pmatrix} \binom{B_{\mu}}{W^{3}_{\mu}} \: .
\end{equation}

\noindent where $A_{\mu}$ refers to the (massless) photon and $Z_{\mu}$ to the Z boson.
Indeed, by replacing the new fields back in [[eq:ew_lagrangian_long_nc]], we get:

#+NAME: eq:final_lagrangian_nc
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}_{\text{NC}} = \overline{\Psi}\gamma^\mu\biggl(g\sin\theta_{\text{W}}I_{3}+g^\prime\cos\theta_{\text{W}}\frac{\mathcal{Y}}{2}\biggr)\Psi A_\mu + \overline{\Psi}\gamma^\mu\biggl(g\cos\theta_{\text{W}}I_{3}-g^\prime\sin\theta_{\text{W}}\frac{\mathcal{Y}}{2}\biggr)\Psi Z_\mu
\end{equation}

\noindent The first term can be interpreted as the current that couples the photon field $A_\mu$ with fermions $\Psi$ by setting the electric charge as:

#+NAME: eq:connection_electric_charge
\begin{equation}
g\sin\theta_{\text{W}}I_{3}+g^\prime\cos\theta_{\text{W}}\frac{\mathcal{Y}}{2} = eQ
\end{equation}

The hypercharge $\mathcal{Y}$ multiplies the coupling $g^\prime$, and thus leaves spaces from some arbitariness in its value.
With the appropriate choice of $\mathcal{Y}(\bar{\Psi_{\text{L}}})=-1$, and considering the quantum numbers of the leptons in the up and down components of the doublets in [[eq:quarks_and_leptons]], a set of equations can be obtained:

#+NAME: eq:system_nijishima
\begin{equation}
\begin{cases}
0 = \frac{g}{2}\sin\theta_{\text{W}}-\frac{g^\prime}{2}\cos\theta_{\text{W}}\\
-e = -\frac{g}{2}\sin\theta_{\text{W}}-\frac{g^\prime}{2}\cos\theta_{\text{W}}
\end{cases}\,.
\end{equation}

\noindent so that:

#+NAME: eq:equality_nijishima
\begin{equation}
g\sin\theta_{\text{W}} = g^\prime\cos\theta_{\text{W}}=e
\end{equation}

and the /Gell-Mann--Nishijima/ relation becomes apparent:

#+NAME: eq:gellmann_nijishima
\begin{equation}
Q=I_{3}+\frac{\mathcal{Y}}{2}
\end{equation}

\noindent The remaining hypercharge values can be computed from [[eq:gellmann_nijishima]], leading to $Y(\psi_{\text{R}})=0$ and $Y(\psi^{\prime}_{\text{R}})=-2$.
The neutral current term can be finally rewritten as follows:

#+NAME: eq:lagrangian_nc_rewritten
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}_{\text{NC}} = e\bar{\Psi}\gamma^\mu Q\Psi A_\mu + e\bar{\Psi}\gamma^\mu \frac{I_{3} - Q \sin^{2}\theta_{\text{W}}}{\cos\theta_{\text{W}}\sin\theta_{\text{W}}} \Psi Z_\mu
\end{equation}

\noindent The charged current interactions couple the left spinors and is mediated by two W bosons, while the interactions arising from the neutral current are seemingly mediated by the third W boson and the B field.

The model presented in this section does manage to integrate the electromagnetic and weak forces into the same framework.
However, while photons and gluons are massless, vector bosons are known to be massive, but Dirac mass terms are not gauge invariant to the symmetries so far explored.
Would we add those terms anyways, and unrenormalizable divergences would appear, getting more severe at each additional loop order.
Instead, an alternative existed, known as the /Higgs mechanism/, and is described in [[#sec:higgs_mechanism]].


\myparagraph{Electroweak interaction}

\noindent The vector boson mediators of the weak interactions, like the photons in \ac{QED} and the gluons in \ac{QCD}, are the charged $\text{W}^+$ and $\text{W}^{+-}$, and the neutral Z, with the following experimentally measured masses [[cite:&wmasscomb;&zmasscomb;&cdf_wzmass]]:

#+NAME: eq:wz_masses
\begin{equation}
\mw = 80.3692 \pm 0.0133 \,\si{\GeV} \: , \:\:\:\: \mz = 91.1880 \pm 0.0020 \,\si{\GeV}
\end{equation}

The couplings of W's to leptons only happens within each generation.
No cross-generational coupling is allowed in the \ac{SM}, such as $e^{-} \rightarrow \nu_{\mu} W^{-}$.
In the case of quarks, there is instead generation mixing via the \ac{CKM} matrix:

#+NAME: eq:ckm_matrix1
\begin{equation}
\begin{pmatrix}
  d^{\prime} \\
  s^{\prime} \\
  b^{\prime}
\end{pmatrix}
=
V_{\text{CKM}} 
\begin{pmatrix}
  d \\
  s \\
  b
\end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}

\noindent where the magnitude of the \ac{CKM} elements are experimentally measured to be [[cite:&PDG 12]]:

#+NAME: eq:ckm_matrix2
\begin{equation}
| V_{\text{CKM}} | = 
\begin{pmatrix}
  0.97435 \pm 0.00016             & 0.22501 \pm 0.000658            & 0.003732^{+0.000090}_{-0.000085} \\
  0.22487 \pm 0.00068             & 0.97349 \pm 0.00016             & 0.04183^{+0.00079}_{-0.00069}    \\
  0.00858^{+0.00019}_{-0.00017} & 0.04111^{+0.00077}_{-0.00068} & 0.999118^{+0.000029}_{-0.000034}
\end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}

\noindent where the "weak interaction generations" are related to the physical quark states.
