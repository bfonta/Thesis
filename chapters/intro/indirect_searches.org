+ Investigating the Higgs self-couplings through HHH production [[https://indico.cern.ch/event/1291157/contributions/5876758/attachments/2900751/5086982/Panagiotis_Stylianou_ICHEP24.pdf][talk]]



Although single Higgs production does not depend in $\lh{3}$ at \ac{LO} or at higher orders in \ac{QCD}, it does depend on it thorugh weak loops, namely in \ac{EW} interactions at \ac{NLO}, as shown in the diagrams of [[fig:single_higgs_indirect_production]], for production, and [[fig:single_higgs_indirect_decay]], for decays [[cite:&indirect_searches1]].

An alternative method was developed to extract information on the trilinear Higgs coupling without using Higgs boson pair production.
Once can explore \ac{NLO} electroweak loops present in single Higgs production featuring the trilinear Higgs vertex.
It has also been proposed to use higher-order diagrams of \ac{EW} processes, such as $\mw$ and $\sint$ measurements, with the same goal [[cite:&indirect_searches_ew]].
The production modes with the largest kinematic dependence on $\lh{3}$ are \tth{} and \vh{} [[cite:&indirect_searches2]], with differences of up to 10%.

The bounds obtained from indirect searches are competitive with the ones from di-Higgs production [[cite:&indirect_searches3]], and provide additional constraints for single Higgs couplings (see [[#sec:combinations]]).
Nevertheless, departures of the Higgs self-coupling from its \ac{SM} prediction signal the existence
of new dynamics that, in general, would leave an imprint on other Higgs couplings.
The importance of a global fit is therefore two-fold, namely to assess the robustness of the studies that take into account deformations exclusively in the Higgs trilinear coupling, and to single out the sensitivity on the single-Higgs couplings that is required to minimise the impact of the possible correlations [[cite:&hllhc_physics]].

Single and double Higgs processes are extremely complementary [[cite:&indirect_searches4]].
