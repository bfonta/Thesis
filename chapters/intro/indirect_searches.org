An alternative method was developed to extract information on the trilinear Higgs coupling without using Higgs boson pair production.
Once can explore \ac{NLO} electroweak loops present in single Higgs production featuring the trilinear Higgs vertex.
It has also been proposed to use higher-order diagrams of \ac{EW} processes, such as $\mw$ and $\sint$ measurements, with the same goal [[cite:&indirect_searches_ew]].
The production modes with the largest kinematic dependence on $\lh{3}$ are \tth{} and \vh{} [[cite:&indirect_searches2]], with differences of up to 10%.

The bounds obtained from indirect searches are competitive with the ones from di-Higgs production [[cite:&indirect_searches3]], and provide additional constraints for single Higgs couplings (see ref:sec:combinations).
Nevertheless, departures of the Higgs self-coupling from its \ac{SM} prediction signal the existence
of new dynamics that, in general, would leave an imprint on other Higgs couplings.
The importance of a global fit is therefore two-fold, namely to assess the robustness of the studies that take into account deformations exclusively in the Higgs trilinear coupling, and to single out the sensitivity on the single-Higgs couplings that is required to minimise the impact of the possible correlations [[cite:&hllhc_physics]].

Single and double Higgs processes are extremely complementary [[cite:&indirect_searches4]].
