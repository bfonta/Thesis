@mention impact of bb\tau\tau@

The most up-to-date Run2 HH combination constrains the observed (expected) HH cross-section to $\xshh < 3.4\;(2.5)\;\xshhsm$, where the sensitivity is dominated by the $4b$, $bb\tau\tau$ and $bb\gamma\gamma$ channels. The limit is also interpreted as a function of the $\kl$ and $\k2v$ coupling modifiers, measuring $-1.24 < \kl < 6.49$ and $0.67 < \kvv < 1.38$, respectively. Importantly, the latter result allows the exclusion of $\kvv=0$ at 6.6 standard deviations.

#+CAPTION: Combined expected and observed 95% CL upper limits on the HH production cross-section for different values of $\kl$ (left) and $\kvv$ (right), assuming the SM values for the modifiers of Higgs boson couplings to top quarks and vector bosons. The green and yellow bands represent the 1$\sigma$ and 2$\sigma$ extensions beyond the expected limit, respectively; the red solid line (band) shows the theoretical prediction for the HH production cross-section (its 1$\sigma$ uncertainty). The areas to the left and to the right of the hatched regions are excluded at the 95% CL. Taken from [[cite:&higgs_10_years]].

The expected limits assume no HH production or no \ac{VBF} HH production, respectively. The \ac{ggF} HH production cross-section is assumed to be as predicted by the SM in the right plot. The red line shows the theory prediction for the \ac{ggF} and \ac{VBF} HH production cross-section as a function of $\kl$ (left), and the predicted \ac{VBF} HH cross-section as a function of $\kvv$ (right). The bands surrounding the red cross-section lines indicate the theoretical uncertainties on the predicted cross-sections. Taken from [[cite:&atlas_hh_comb]].

The \ac{ggF} or \ac{VBF} HH production cross-section is fixed to the SM predicted value for $\mh=125\,\si{\GeV}$ when deriving limits on the respective signal strength.

On top of the HH searches already mentioned, $\kl$ can be additionally constrained by exploiting \ac{NLO} \ac{EW} corrections to single Higgs processes, which also depend on $\kl$.
Single Higgs cross-sections can indeed be quite sensitive to $\kl$ variations, especially in the \vh{} and \tth{} production modes, where up to 10% differences are expected.
Additionally, there is a strong complementarity between direct and indirect searches [[cite:&indirect_searches2]].
HH searches generally provide weaker contraints on the Higgs boson coupling to fermions and vector bosons, due to the lower production cross-section with respect to single Higgs.
On the other hand, double Higgs processes provide stronger constraints on $\kl$.

The main challenge of the combination recently performed by \ac{CMS} [[cite:&CMSHplusHHcomb]] consists on estimating and efficiently removing overlaps between signal regions of different analysis.
The mitigation of double-counting and minimization of overlaps, together with the combination of event categories from both single and double-Higgs analysis, lead to stronger $\kl$ constraints.
The analysis with the most sensitive production modes are included.
Whenever overlaps exist, one of two approaches is taken: either additional selections are applied, or the least sensitive category or analysis is removed.
As an example, the \bbzz{} analysis is removed in favour of \zzfourl{} due to the former's relatively low sensitivity to $\kl$.
Concerning systematics, their modelling in HH processes is generally simpler when compared to single H, due to the limited statistics of HH.

\ac{CMS} observed exclusion intervals at 95% \ac{CL} of $-0.4 < \kl < 6.3$, assuming other Higgs couplings to follow the \ac{SM}, or $-1.4 < k_{\lambda} < 6.1$ otherwise.
For comparison, \ac{ATLAS} observed $-0.4 < \kl < 6.3$, assuming \ac{SM} couplings, or $-1.4 < k_{\lambda} < 6.1$ otherwise [[cite:&ATLASHplusHHcomb]].
We show ($\kl$, $\kt$) and ($\kv$, $\kvv$) scans in [[fig:combination_2d_scans]], where the complementarity between the two types of processes is clearly highlighted.
\ac{CMS} was also able to once again [[cite:&higgs_10_years]] exclude $\kvv=0$ at more than 5\sigma, this time without fixing $\kv=1$.
