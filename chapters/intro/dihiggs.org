The Higgs self-coupling $\lh{3}$ plays a central role in the spontaneous symmetry breaking of electroweak theory, and governs the sole scalar interaction so far observed in Nature.
The connection to the \ac{SM} is established via the Higgs potential in [[eq:sm_potential]], where the triple and quartic Higgs couplings are predicted.
These couplings are the last fundamental \ac{SM} pieces left to be measured, and provide a unique \ac{SM} consistency test, representing a crucial validation of the \ac{EWSB} mechanism [[cite:&YellowReport4]].
The shape of the Higgs potential itself would evidently be affected in case of \ac{BSM} deviations, leading to dramatic consequences for our understanding of the Universe.

Experimentally, one aims to verify if the relationships in [[eq:self_couplings]] hold.
However, as discussed in [[#sec:production]], the available experimental signatures often involve different types of interactions, which do not simply include the Higgs self-couplings.
It is therefore necessary to disentangle $\lh{3}$ contributions from other effects.
Often, simultaneous fits of multiple couplings are performed, when a particular process under study is influenced by more than one production mode.
Furthermore, all HH processes carry a very small total cross section, placing them as some of the rarest processes currently probed at \ac{CMS}.
Challenges can also be related to the final states explored, which are often complex, including multiple decay products with jets and/or \ac{MET}.
