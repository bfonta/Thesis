The Higgs mechanism revolutionized Particle Physics, and has driven \ac{HEP} experiments and studies for the past \num{\sim 50} years, of which this thesis is a mere example.
The mechanism is responsible for generating the masses of the W and Z gauge bosons, and for explaining the masses of fermions.
At its core, it is based on symmetry breaking, a phenomenon widely present in Nature, and exemplified in [[fig:symmetries]], left.
A striking example appears in biology [[cite:&chirality_bio_1;&chirality_bio_2]], where all known molecules that are central to life have just one out of two possible chiralities: the DNA and RNA are right-handed, while aminoacids and proteins are all left-handed.
We instead speak of /spontaneous/ symmetry breaking when some symmetry is broken without the presence of an external agent, contrary to what happens, for instance, when gravity breaks the 3D space symmetry, establishing a difference between "up" and "down" [[cite:&griffiths]].
With spontaneous symmetry breaking, the true symmetry of the system is simply hidden by the necessary choice of an asymmetrical lower energy state.
We can for instance think of a plastic rod being compressed along its longitudinal axis ([[fig:symmetries]], middle): before applying a vertical force the system is symmetric under rotations, but after being compressed the ground state necessarily breaks the symmetry[fn:: Spontaneous symmetry breaking is also present in the most recent diffusion models for content generation [[cite:&spontaneous_breaking_diffusion]]!].

In the context of \ac{HEP}, it is the presence of an additional scalar field what spontaneously breaks the symmetry of the original \ac{EW} lagrangian in [[eq:ew_lagrangian]].
The theory starts by introducing a $\text{SU}(2)_{\text{L}}$ doublet with 4 scalar real fields:

#+NAME: eq:su2_doublet
\begin{equation}
\phi = \binom{\phi_+}{\phi^0} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \binom{\phi^1+i\phi^2}{\phi^3+i\phi^4}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\phi$ must be a scalar due to space isotropy and homogeneity arguments.
To introduce this term in the \ac{SM} lagrangian, we introduce the Higgs lagrangian with standard kinetic and potential terms:

#+NAME: eq:higgs_lagrangian_short
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}_{\text{H}} = \left( D_{\mu}\phi \right)^{\dag}\left( D^{\mu}\phi \right) - V(\phi^{\dag}\phi)
\end{equation}
            
\noindent where $D_{\mu}$ is the covariant derivative introduced in [[eq:ew_covariant]].
The Higgs potential can be written as:

#+NAME: eq:sm_orig_potential
\begin{equation}
V(\phi^{\dag}\phi) = -\mu^2\phi^{\dag}\phi + \lambda\left(\phi^{\dag}\phi\right)^2\,, \:\:\:\: \text{with}\:\:\: \mu^{2}\,,\,\lambda>0 
\end{equation}

\noindent and is illustrated in illustrated in [[fig:symmetries]] (right).
The minima of the potential are clearly not located at $\phi=0$, but satisfy instead $|\phi^{2}| = \mu^{2} / 2\lambda$, which describes a circle in the complex plane.
Once a particular minimum is chosen, the $\text{SU(2)}_{\text{L}}\otimes\text{U(1)}_{\text{Y}}$ symmetry is broken, but the ground state remains invariant under the $\text{U(1)}_{\text{EM}}$ symmetry, since it remains parallel to $\phi^{0}$.
By defining the \ac{VEV} as $v=\mu/\sqrt{\lambda}$ and expanding around the true minimum, the field is treated as a fluctuation around the ground state, and can be rewritten as:

#+NAME: eq:expand_potential
\begin{equation}
\phi(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \exp \left[ \frac{i\sigma_{i}\theta^{i}(x)}{v} \right] \binom{0}{v + \text{H}(x)} \: ,
\end{equation}

\noindent where the sum across $i$ is implied.
[[eq:expand_potential]] is interpreted as the presence of a scalar real massive field H and three massless fields $\theta^{i}$.
The massless fields follow from Goldstone's theorem [[cite:&goldstone]], which states that whenever a continuous symmetry is not apparent in the ground state, or spontaneously broken, a number of massless bosons will be generated equal to the number of the broken generators of the symmetry, in this case three.
By applying the "unitary gauge" transformation on top, we can easily see that the $\theta^{i}$ bosons are unphysical:

#+NAME: eq:unitary_gauge
\begin{equation}
\phi(x) \rightarrow e^{-\frac{i}{v}\sigma_j\theta^j(x)} \phi(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \binom{0}{v+H(x)} \: .
\end{equation}

\noindent Only one scalar field remains, corresponding to a new scalar boson, the Higgs particle.
Curiously, the Higgs boson is the only known scalar field.
Using the definition of covariant derivative in [[eq:ew_covariant]] plus the unitary gauge in the lagrangian [[eq:higgs_lagrangian_short]], we obtain:

#+NAME: eq:higgs_lagrangian_full
\begin{equation}
  \begin{split}
  \mathcal{L}_{\text{H}} & = \frac{1}{2}\partial^{\mu}\text{H}\partial_{\mu}\text{H} - \frac{1}{2}\left(2\lambda v^2\right)\text{H}^2 \\
                    & + \left[\left(\frac{gv}{2}\right)^{2}\text{W}^{\mu+}\text{W}_{\mu}^{-} + \frac{\left(g^2+g^{\prime2}\right)v^2}{8}\text{Z}^{\mu}\text{Z}_{\mu}\right]\left(1+\frac{\text{H}}{v}\right)^2 \\
                    & + \lambda v\text{H}^3 + \frac{1}{4}\lambda \text{H}^4 - \frac{1}{4}\lambda v^4 \: ,
  \end{split}
\end{equation}

\noindent where the Higgs mass term in the first line establishes a new free parameter of the theory, $\mh = \sqrt{2\lambda}v = \sqrt{2}\mu$, and the second line shows mass terms for the W and Z gauge bosons, where their masses are similarly given by the square root of the multiplicative term in front of the respective fields.
The unitary gauge effectively removed the Goldstone bosons $\theta^{i}$, which were absorbed as additional degrees of freedom of the weak gauge bosons, corresponding to their longitudinal polarizations.
This is referred as the Higgs mechanism.
We can finally introduce the Higgs potential $V$ as it is usually presented:

#+NAME: eq:sm_potential
\begin{equation}
V(\text{H}) = \frac{1}{2}\mh^{2}\text{H}^{2} + \lh{3}v\text{H}^{3} + \frac{\lh{4}}{4}\text{H}^{4} \: ,
\end{equation}

\noindent with the self-couplings defined as:

#+NAME: eq:self_couplings
\begin{equation}
\lh{3}^{\text{SM}} = \frac{G_{F}}{\sqrt{2}}\mh^{2} = \frac{\mh^{2}}{2v^{2}} \simeq 0.13 \:,\:\:\:\: \lh{3} = \lh{4} \: .
\end{equation}

\noindent We can conclude that the Higgs self-couplings are fully determined in the \ac{SM}, given that both $\mh$ and $v$ have been measured, the latter depending on Fermi's constant $G_{F}$, which is measured with muon decays.
From an experimental point of view, the Higgs boson thus provides a unique opportunity to perform a \ac{SM} closure test, independent from the gauge interactions of the electroweak sector.

The Higgs mechanism represents an economical way to provide mass to the weak bosons in the theory.
Additionally, it can be shown that the new massive bosons preserve renormalizability [[cite:&hooft]].
However, a second feat is yet to be achieved: justify the existence of fermion masses.
To do so, Yukawa (renormalizable) terms are added to the \ac{SM} lagrangian, coupling left to right chiral fields as follows:

#+NAME: eq:yukawa_lagrangian
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}_{\text{Yukawa}} = -y_{f^\prime} \left( \bar{\Psi}_{\text{L}}\phi\psi_{\text{R}}^{\prime} + \bar{\psi}^{\prime}_{\text{R}}\phi^{\dagger} \Psi_L \right) - y_{f}\left(\bar{\Psi}_{\text{L}} \tilde{\phi} \psi_{\text{R}} + \bar{\psi}_{\text{R}} \tilde{\phi}^{\dagger} \Psi_L \right) \: ,
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\psi$ and $\psi^{\prime}$ denote up and down fermions ($I_3 = 1/2$ and $I_3 = âˆ’1/2$), and:

#+NAME: eq:yukawa_definitions
\begin{equation}
\tilde{\phi} = i\sigma_{2}\phi^{*} = \binom{\phi_{0}^{*}}{-\phi_{+}^{*}} \hspace{3mm} \xmapsto[]{\hspace{1mm} \text{EWSB} \hspace{1mm}} \:\:\: \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\binom{v+\text{H}(x)}{0} \: .
\end{equation}

\noindent After \ac{EWSB}, using [[eq:unitary_gauge]] and [[eq:yukawa_definitions]], and summing over fermion up and down types, [[eq:yukawa_definitions]] is simplified to:

#+NAME: eq:yukawa_definitions
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}_{\text{Yukawa}} = - \sum_f m_f\left( \bar{\psi}_\text{L} \psi_{\text{R}} + \bar{\psi}_\text{R} \psi_{\text{L}} \right) \left( 1 + \frac{H}{v} \right) \: ,
\end{equation}

\noindent with new $y_{f}v/\sqrt{2}$ mass terms for the fermions.
The \ac{SM} therefore explains fermion masses by introducing /ad hoc/ Yukawa coupling terms between the Higgs field and all fermion fields, breaking the symmetry between the three lepton families.
At the same time, the origin or fundamental reason for such terms remains unknown.
The Higgs mechanism does however predict a linear proportionality between the masses of all fermions and all gauge bosons (recall [[eq:higgs_lagrangian_full]]), as experimentally verified by \ac{CMS} and \ac{ATLAS}, and shown in [[fig:linear_fermions_bosons]].
The Higgs field also an enormous impact in other fronts.
As we will see in [[#sec:dihiggs]], there is a strong link between the $\lh{3}$ and $\lh{4}$ self-couplings with the stability of the vacuum.
The Higgs boson is also speculated to be connected to inflation, dark matter production, and baryogenesis.
The last item is briefly discussed in [[#sec:ewpt]].

#+CAPTION: The measured coupling modifiers of the Higgs boson to fermions and heavy gauge bosons, as functions of fermion or gauge boson mass, where $v$ is the vacuum expectation value of the Higgs field. For gauge bosons, the square root of the coupling modifier is plotted, to keep a linear proportionality to the mass, as predicted in the \ac{SM}. Measurements used full \run{2} \ac{LHC} data. Their p-value with respect to the \ac{SM} prediction is 37.5% (\ac{CMS}, left) and 65% (\ac{ATLAS}, right). Taken from [[cite:&higgs_10_years;&higgs_atlas_nature_10years]].
