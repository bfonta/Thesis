@Explain how the non-zero value of the Higgs field that permeates the Universe breaks electro-weak symmetry (related to the EWPT section)@

At low energy the potential $V$ associated to the Higgs boson field $H$ in the SM Lagrangian can be expressed as:

#+NAME: eq:sm_potential
\begin{equation}
V(\text{H}) = \frac{1}{2}\mh^{2}\text{H}^{2} + \lh{3}v\text{H}^{3} + \frac{\lh{4}}{4}\text{H}^{4}
\end{equation}

\noindent Continue here.

#+NAME: eq:self_coupling
\begin{equation}
\lh{3}^{\text{SM}} = \frac{G_{F}}{\sqrt{2}}\mh^{2} = \frac{\mh^{2}}{2v^{2}} \simeq 0.13
\end{equation}

#+NAME: eq:dihiggs_coupling_relation
\begin{equation}
\lh{3} = \lh{4}
\end{equation}

+ The Higgs mechanism is the most economical way to endow fundamental particles with mass while  the SM gauge invariant and predictive
+ the higgs is the only known scalar field in the theory
+ it does not arise from a local gauge invariance propert of the SM Lagrangian
+ mention the "generation of mass", which breaks the symmetry between the three lepton families
+ the Higgs might be connected to inflation, to dark matter production, to baryogenesis and to vacuum instability
