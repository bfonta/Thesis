The Higgs mechanism revolutionized Particle Physics, and has driven \ac{HEP} experiments and studies for the past \num{\sim 50} years, of which this thesis is a mere example.
The mechanism is responsible for generating the masses of the W and Z gauge bosons, and for explaining the masses of fermions.
At its core, it is based on symmetry breaking, a phenomenon widely present in Nature, and exemplified in [[fig:symmetries]], left.
A striking example appears in biology [[cite:&chirality_bio_1;&chirality_bio_2]], where all known molecules that are central to life have just one out of two possible chiralities: the DNA and RNA are right-handed, while aminoacids and proteins are all left-handed.
We instead speak of /spontaneous/ symmetry breaking when some symmetry is broken without the presence of an external agent, contrary to what happens, for instance, when gravity breaks the 3D space symmetry, establishing a difference between "up" and "down" [[cite:&griffiths]].
With spontaneous symmetry breaking, the true symmetry of the system is simply hidden by the necessary choice of an asymmetrical lower energy state.
We can for instance think of a plastic rod being compressed along its longitudinal axis ([[fig:symmetries]], middle): before applying a vertical force the system is symmetric under rotations, but after being compressed the ground state necessarily breaks the symmetry[fn:: Spontaneous symmetry breaking is also present in the most recent diffusion models for content generation [[cite:&spontaneous_breaking_diffusion]]!].

In the context of \ac{HEP}, it is the presence of an additional scalar field what spontaneously breaks the symmetry of the original electroweak lagrangian in [[eq:ew_lagrangian_short]].
The theory starts by introducing a $\text{SU}(2)_{\text{L}}$ doublet with 4 scalar real fields:

#+NAME: eq:su2_doublet
\begin{equation}
\phi = \binom{\phi_+}{\phi^0} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \binom{\phi^1+i\phi^2}{\phi^3+i\phi^4}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\phi$ must be a scalar due to space isotropy and homogeneity arguments.
To introduce this term in the \ac{SM} lagrangian, we introduce the Higgs lagrangian with standard kinetic and potential terms:

#+NAME: eq:higgs_lagrangian_short
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}_{\text{H}} = \left( D_{\mu}\phi \right)^{\dag}\left( D^{\mu}\phi \right) - V(\phi^{\dag}\phi)
\end{equation}
            
\noindent where $D_{\mu}$ is the covariant derivative introduced in [[eq:ew_covariant]].
The Higgs potential can be written as:

#+NAME: eq:sm_orig_potential
\begin{equation}
V(\phi^{\dag}\phi) = -\mu^2\phi^{\dag}\phi + \lambda\left(\phi^{\dag}\phi\right)^2\,, \:\:\:\: \text{with}\:\:\: \mu^{2}\,,\,\lambda>0 
\end{equation}

\noindent and is illustrated in illustrated in [[fig:symmetries]] (right).
The minima of the potential are clearly not located at $\phi=0$, but satisfy instead $|\phi^{2}| = \mu^{2} / 2\lambda$, which describes a circle in the complex plane.
Once a particular minimum is chosen, the $\text{SU(2)}_{\text{L}}\otimes\text{U(1)}_{\text{Y}}$ symmetry is broken, but the ground state remains invariant under the $\text{U(1)}_{\text{EM}}$ symmetry, since it remains parallel to $\phi^{0}$.
By defining the \ac{VEV} as $v=\mu/\sqrt{\lambda}$ and expanding around the true minimum, the field is treated as a fluctuation around the ground state, and can be rewritten as:

#+NAME: eq:expand_potential
\begin{equation}
\phi(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \exp \left[ \frac{i\sigma_{i}\theta^{i}(x)}{v} \right] \binom{0}{v + \text{H}(x)} \: ,
\end{equation}

\noindent where the sum across $i$ is implied.
[[eq:expand_potential]] is interpreted as the presence of a scalar real massive field H and three massless fields $\theta^{i}$.
The massless fields follow from Goldstone's theorem [[cite:&goldstone]], which states that whenever a continuous symmetry is not apparent in the ground state, or spontaneously broken, a number of massless bosons will be generated equal to the number of the broken generators of the symmetry, in this case three.
By applying the /unitary gauge/ transformation on top, we can easily see that the $\theta^{i}$ bosons are unphysical:

#+NAME: eq:unitary_gauge
\begin{equation}
\phi(x) \rightarrow e^{-\frac{i}{v}\sigma_j\theta^j(x)} \phi(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \binom{0}{v+H(x)} \: .
\end{equation}

\noindent Only one scalar field remains, corresponding to a new scalar boson, the Higgs particle.
Curiously, the Higgs boson is the only known scalar field.
Using the definition of covariant derivative in [[eq:ew_covariant]] plus the unitary gauge in the lagrangian [[eq:higgs_lagrangian_short]], we obtain:

#+NAME: eq:higgs_lagrangian_full
\begin{equation}
  \begin{split}
  \mathcal{L}_{\text{H}} & = \frac{1}{2}\partial^{\mu}\text{H}\partial_{\mu}\text{H} - \frac{1}{2}\left(2\lambda v^2\right)\text{H}^2 \\
                    & + \left[\left(\frac{gv}{2}\right)^{2}\text{W}^{\mu+}\text{W}_{\mu}^{-} + \frac{\left(g^2+g^{\prime2}\right)v^2}{8}\text{Z}^{\mu}\text{Z}_{\mu}\right]\left(1+\frac{\text{H}}{v}\right)^2 \\
                    & + \lambda v\text{H}^3 + \frac{1}{4}\lambda \text{H}^4 - \frac{1}{4}\lambda v^4 \: ,
  \end{split}
\end{equation}

\noindent where the Higgs mass term in the first line establishes a new free parameter of the theory, $\mh = \sqrt{2\lambda}v = \sqrt{2}\mu$, and the second line shows mass terms for the W and Z gauge bosons:

#+NAME: eq:wz_masses_formula
\begin{equation}
\mw^{2} = \frac{g^{2}v^{2}}{4} \: , \:\:\:\: \mz^{2} = \frac{(g^{2}+g^{\prime2})v^{2}}{4} \: .
\end{equation}

\noindent These masses have been experimentally measured to be [[cite:&wmasscomb;&zmasscomb;&cdf_wzmass]]:

#+NAME: eq:wz_masses_measured
\begin{equation}
\mw = 80.3692 \pm 0.0133 \,\si{\GeV} \: , \:\:\:\: \mz = 91.1880 \pm 0.0020 \,\si{\GeV}
\end{equation}

\noindent The unitary gauge effectively removed the Goldstone bosons $\theta^{i}$, which were absorbed as additional degrees of freedom of the weak gauge bosons, corresponding to their longitudinal polarizations.
We can finally introduce the Higgs potential $V$ as it is usually presented:

#+NAME: eq:sm_potential
\begin{equation}
V(\text{H}) = \frac{1}{2}\mh^{2}\text{H}^{2} + \lh{3}v\text{H}^{3} + \frac{\lh{4}}{4}\text{H}^{4} \: ,
\end{equation}

\noindent with the self-couplings defined as:

#+NAME: eq:self_couplings
\begin{equation}
\lh{3} = \frac{G_{F}}{\sqrt{2}}\mh^{2} = \frac{\mh^{2}}{2v^{2}} \simeq 0.13 \:,\:\:\:\: \lh{3} = \lh{4} \: .
\end{equation}

\noindent We can conclude that the Higgs self-couplings are fully determined in the \ac{SM}, given the measurements of $\mh$ and $v$, the latter fixed by Fermi's constant $G_{F}$, which is measured via muon decays.
From an experimental point of view, the Higgs boson thus provides a unique opportunity to perform a \ac{SM} closure test, independently from the gauge interactions of the electroweak sector.

* The Yukawa couplings

The Higgs mechanism represents an economical way to provide mass to the weak bosons in the theory.
Additionally, it can be shown that the new massive bosons preserve renormalizability [[cite:&hooft]].
However, a second feat is yet to be achieved: justify the existence of fermion masses.
To do so, Yukawa (renormalizable) $\text{SU(2)}_{\text{L}}\otimes\text{U(1)}_{\text{Y}}$ invariant terms are added to the \ac{SM} lagrangian, coupling left to right chiral fields:

#+NAME: eq:yukawa_lagrangian
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}_{\text{Yukawa}} = -y_{f^\prime} \left( \bar{\Psi}_{\text{L}}\phi\psi_{\text{R}}^{\prime} + \bar{\psi}^{\prime}_{\text{R}}\phi^{\dagger} \Psi_L \right) - y_{f}\left(\bar{\Psi}_{\text{L}} \tilde{\phi} \psi_{\text{R}} + \bar{\psi}_{\text{R}} \tilde{\phi}^{\dagger} \Psi_L \right) \: ,
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\psi$ and $\psi^{\prime}$ denote up and down fermions ($I_3 = 1/2$ and $I_3 = âˆ’1/2$, respectively, see [[eq:chiral_components]]), and:

#+NAME: eq:yukawa_definitions
\begin{equation}
\tilde{\phi} = i\sigma_{2}\phi^{*} = \binom{\phi_{0}^{*}}{-\phi_{+}^{*}} \hspace{3mm} \xmapsto[]{\hspace{1mm} \text{EWSB} \hspace{1mm}} \:\:\: \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\binom{v+\text{H}(x)}{0} \: .
\end{equation}

\noindent If we want for instance to generate the electron mass, it suffices to replace the fields with $\bar{\Psi}_{\text{L}} = (\bar{\nu_{e}},\bar{e})$ and similarly for the right-handed singlets.
Note that fermion mass terms of the form $m\bar{\psi}\psi$ are forbidden by gauge invariance, and it is the addition of the Higgs doublet which changes the scenario.

After \ac{EWSB}, using [[eq:unitary_gauge]] and [[eq:yukawa_definitions]], and summing over fermion up and down types, [[eq:yukawa_definitions]] is simplified to:

#+NAME: eq:fermion_masses
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}_{\text{Yukawa}} = - \sum_f m_f\left( \bar{\psi}_\text{L} \psi_{\text{R}} + \bar{\psi}_\text{R} \psi_{\text{L}} \right) \left( 1 + \frac{\text{H}}{v} \right) \: ,
\end{equation}

\noindent with new $m_{f} = y_{f}v/\sqrt{2}$ mass terms for the fermions.
Very importantly, we are here simplifying the calculations: [[eq:yukawa_lagrangian]] can be expressed as a series of mass terms only after diagonalizing the original Yukawa matrices that multiply the fields.
The process of diagonalization implies that the lepton fields are not mass eigenstates; they have to be redefined as in $\psi^{\prime} \rightarrow U\psi$.
When the redefinition is propagated back to the full \ac{EW} lagrangian, only the term containing charged currents is modified:

#+NAME: eq:ckm_lagrangian
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}_{\text{CC}} = \frac{e}{\sqrt{2}\sin\theta_{\text{W}}} W_{\mu}^{+} V_{\text{CKM}} \left(\bar{\psi}_{\text{L}}\gamma^\mu\psi_{\text{L}}^{\prime} \right) + \text{h.c.} \:,
\end{equation}

\noindent where the last term refers to the hermitian conjugate to simplify the expression, and $V_{\text{CKM}}$ is the \ac{CKM} matrix, receiving contributions from the two diagonalized fields $\psi_{\text{L}}$.
The \ac{CKM} matrix describes the mixing between all quark generations, and is what makes possible the existence of flavour-changing charged currents in the \ac{SM}.
This is not the case for leptons, where couplings to charged W's only happen within each generation; a decay like $e^{-} \rightarrow \nu_{\mu} W^{-}$ is not allowed.
The values of the \ac{CKM} are shown in the following:

#+NAME: eq:ckm_matrix1
\begin{equation}
\begin{pmatrix}
  d^{\prime} \\
  s^{\prime} \\
  b^{\prime}
\end{pmatrix}
=
V_{\text{CKM}} 
\begin{pmatrix}
  d \\
  s \\
  b
\end{pmatrix}
\: ,
\end{equation}

#+NAME: eq:ckm_matrix2
\begin{equation}
| V_{\text{CKM}} | = 
\begin{pmatrix}
  0.97435 \pm 0.00016             & 0.22501 \pm 0.000658            & 0.003732^{+0.000090}_{-0.000085} \\
  0.22487 \pm 0.00068             & 0.97349 \pm 0.00016             & 0.04183^{+0.00079}_{-0.00069}    \\
  0.00858^{+0.00019}_{-0.00017} & 0.04111^{+0.00077}_{-0.00068} & 0.999118^{+0.000029}_{-0.000034}
\end{pmatrix}
\: ,
\end{equation}

\noindent where the experimentally measured [[cite:&PDG 12]] magnitudes of the \ac{CKM} elements represent the probability amplitude for a quark $i$ to transform into a quark $j$.
The matrix also includes an additional phase, which will further discussed in [[#sec:short_comings]].
Since the mass diagonalization does not affect neutral currents, neutral processes changing the flavour of fermions are forbidden at first-order in the \ac{SM}.
The fact that the matrix is relatively close of being diagonal implies a preference for couplings within the same generation.
This is for instance why top quarks decay virtually always to b quarks, and other decays channels can be neglected.

The \ac{SM} therefore explains fermion masses by introducing 12 /ad hoc/ Yukawa coupling terms between the Higgs field and all fermion fields, breaking the symmetry between the three lepton families.
At the same time, the origin or fundamental reason for such terms remains unknown, with the masses being free parameters of the theory.
The Higgs mechanism does however predict a proportionality between its couplings and the masses of all fermions and gauge bosons (recall [[eq:higgs_lagrangian_full]]).
This has been experimentally verified by CMS and ATLAS, and is shown in [[fig:linear_fermions_bosons]].
The Higgs field also has an enormous impact in other fronts.
As we will see in [[#sec:dihiggs]], there is a strong link between the $\lh{3}$ and $\lh{4}$ self-couplings with the stability of the vacuum.
The Higgs boson is also speculated to be connected to inflation, dark matter production, and baryogenesis.
The last item is briefly discussed in [[#sec:ewpt]].

Despite strongly motivated, and serving as the main motivation for building the \ac{LHC}, all the above was a matter of pure speculation until very recently.
Since the mass of the new boson was a free parameter of the theory, there was no definite way to guarantee that we could produce a Higgs particle in a \ac{HEP} experiment, despite some argument that suggested otherwise.
We allude to considerations on unitarity and perturbative behaviour implying upper limits of $\mh \lesssim 700\,\si{\GeV}$ [[cite:&higgs_mass_up_bound1;&higgs_mass_up_bound2]], and to lower limits driven by vaccum stability arguments, where the nontrivial minima at $v \neq 0$ will disappear if $\mh$ is too small [[cite:&higgs_mass_down_bound]].
The Higgs boson was finally jointly discovered by the \ac{CMS} and \ac{ATLAS} experiments, and was announced to the world on July 2012 [[cite:&CMS_Higgs_discovery1;&CMS_Higgs_discovery2;&ATLAS_Higgs_discovery]].
All measurements so far suggest that the new particle truly is the predicted \ac{SM} scalar Higgs boson, with zero charge and a mass slightly above \SI{125}{\GeV}.
Interestingly, the value found for $\mh$ almost perfectly maximizes the product of the 14 branching ratios of the \ac{SM} Higgs boson into the known fermion and boson pairs [[cite:&higgs_br_maximum1]].
It is not known if this fact is accidental or if it instead hints at a deeper yet hidden theory, but it certainly increases the richness of Higgs physics to be explored at the \ac{LHC} and beyond.

Their p-value with respect to the \ac{SM} prediction is 37.5% (\ac{CMS}, left) and 65% (\ac{ATLAS}, right). Taken from [[cite:&higgs_10_years;&higgs_atlas_nature_10years]].
