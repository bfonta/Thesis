\Ac{BSM} signatures can naturally be probed in nonresonant modes, \ie{} production modes not created by a resonance decaying to a pair of Higgs bosons.
As in other \ac{HEP} fields, physicists look for deviations from \ac{SM} predictions.
Causes for such deviations are substantiated by many proposed \ac{BSM} theories, but experimentally amount to either a change in the HH production rate, or/and the modification of the shape of some kinematical distributions.

Often, instead of directly measuring the couplings, results are instead expressed as a function of /coupling modifiers/, similar to the signal strength modifiers introduced in [[#sec:higgs_exp_status]].
The coupling modifiers compare the measured couplings with their \ac{SM} expectations.
For the case of the Higgs self-coupling, the definition is $\kl~\equiv~\lh{3}/\lh{3}^{\text{SM}}$, where $\lh{3}$ is fully determined in the \ac{SM} once $v$ and $\mh$ are measured.
\ac{BSM} theories are thus characterized by $\kl \neq 1$.
In [[fig:HH_prod_kl]] we display the running of the HH cross section for several production mechanisms, as a function of $\kl$.
The minima are due to the diagram interference for each production mode, as presented in [[#sec:production]].
Minima notably occur at different $\kl$ values for different production modes, $\kl=2.45$ for \ac{ggF}.
This fact implies a variable constraining power for different modes, depending on the phase-space region being studied.
Other modifiers are similarly defined, namely $\kv~\equiv~\cv/\cv^{\text{SM}}$, for the coupling between two Higgs bosons and one vector boson, and $\kvv~\equiv~\cvv/\cvv^{\text{SM}}$, a quartic coupling between two Higgs bosons and two vector bosons.

The dashed and solid lines denote respectively the \ac{LO} and \ac{NLO} predictions and the bands indicate the \ac{PDF} and scale uncertainties added linearly. The interference minima are not aligned for different production modes. For \ac{ggF} the cross-section is now known at \ac{NNLO} level with finite tio quark mass effects, while the figure displays the values for the \ac{NLO} FTapprox calculation. The figure is taken from [[cite:&HH_xsec_running]].

Deviations of the cross-section of \ac{ggF} HH processes can be parameterised as a function of $\kl$ and $\kt\equiv y_t/y_t^{\text{SM}}$ as follows:

#+NAME: eq:parameterisation_ggf
\begin{alignat}{6}
\sigma_{\text{ggF}}/\sigma_{\text{ggF}}^{\text{SM}} &\sim |\mathcal{A}_{\triangle}|^2&\kl^2\kt^2 &+ |\mathcal{A}_{\square}|^2&\kt^4 &+ \mathcal{I}_{\triangle\square}&\kl\kt^3 \nonumber \\[.6cm]
\sigma_{\text{ggF}}/\sigma_{\text{ggF}}^{\text{SM}} \bigg\rvert_{\sqrt{s}=13\,\si{\GeV}} &\sim 0.28&\kl^2\kt^2 &+ 2.09&\kt^4 &- 1.37&\kl\kt^3
\end{alignat}

\noindent where $\mathcal{A}_{\triangle}$ and $\mathcal{A}_{\square}$ are the amplitudes of the triangle and box \ac{ggF} diagrams, respectively, and $\mathcal{I}_{\triangle\square}$ represents the interference term.
We consider gluon fusion due to its dominant cross-section, but other production modes can be parameterised in similar ways using their corresponding coupling modifiers.

Variations of the coupling modifiers can also have a enormous impact on the shape of kinematical distributions.
Taking the mass of the HH system in [[fig:kl_c_EFT]] (left) as an example, we can see the $\kl=1$ configuration is characterized by a broad peak at \SI{\approx 390}{\GeV}, with a large high-energy tail.
Importantly, the kinematics can be completely altered by smaller or larger $\kl$ values.
Physically, and given the couplings present in the box and triangle diagrams, low $|\kl| \rightarrow 0$ is box-dominated, while large $|\kl|$ values are dictated by the triangle diagram.
The most eye-catching variations occur for $\kl=2.45$, where the interference is maximal, and the distribution goes to zero at \SI{\approx 50}{\GeV}.
Despite the focus on \ac{ggF}, it is worth noting that other production modes also include interferences between different diagrams, as one could already see in [[fig:HH_prod_kl]].
The consequence is clear: kinematic deviations represent a smoking gun for the presence of anomalous couplings.

While the above "$\kappa\text{-framework}$" has been so far effective in quantifying differences with respect to the \ac{SM}, it must be said that is also incluedes some drawbacks.
Theoretical calculations involved are rather complex, and become impractical for high loop orders.
At the same time, uncertainties below \SI{\sim 10}{\percent} require \ac{NLO} calculations.
Another, purely theoretical issue exists.
The $\lh{3}$ is fully determined in the \ac{SM}; by modifying the \ac{SM} with a ratio one is introducing an inconsistency in the \ac{SM}.
The framework cannot also be used to interface \ac{LEP} and \ac{LHC} results, given the different energies involved.
Finally, it cannot be straightforwardly extended to \acp{EFT}, which is a more consistent approach that we present in the following section.

* Effective field theories
Many \ac{BSM} models with \ac{SM}-compatible single Higgs boson signal strengths can exhibit a di-Higgs phenomenology vastly different from the \ac{SM} expectation.
In this sense, a successful discovery of Higgs boson pair production at the LHC and the subsequent measurement of potential deviations from the \ac{SM} constitute an important avenue in the search for physics beyond the \ac{SM}.

To facilitate such a measurement, it is crucial to establish the Higgs boson pair production cross section in the \ac{SM} to the best theoretical accuracy possible and to provide \ac{BSM} benchmarks that reflect the phenomenology of Higgs boson pairs at the LHC in a consistent and concise fashion.
