\Ac{BSM} signatures can naturally be probed in nonresonant modes, \ie{}, production modes not issued by a resonance decaying to a pair of Higgs bosons.
As in other \ac{HEP} fields, physicists look for deviations from \ac{SM} predictions.
Causes for such deviations are substantiated by many proposed \ac{BSM} theories, but experimentally amount to either an enhancement of the HH production rate, and/or the modification of the shape of some kinematical distributions.

Often, instead of measuring directly the several available couplings, results are instead expressed as a function of /coupling modifiers/, similar to the signal strength modifiers introduced in [[#sec:higgs_exp_status]].
The coupling modifiers compare the measured couplings with their \ac{SM} expectations.
For the case of the Higgs self-coupling, the definition is $\kl~\equiv~\lh{3}/\lh{3}^{\text{SM}}$, where $\lh{3}$ is fully determined in the \ac{SM}, once $v$ and $\mh$ are measured.
\ac{BSM} theories are thus characterized by $\kl \neq 1$.
In [[fig:HH_prod_kl]] we display the running of the HH cross section for several production mechanisms, as a function of $\kl$.
The minima are due to the interference between several diagrams for each production mode, as presented in [[#sec:production]].
Minima notably occur at different $\kl$ values for different production modes, $\kl=2.45$ for \ac{ggF}.
This fact implies a varying constraining power for different modes, depending on the phase-space region being studied.
Other modifiers are similarly defined, namely $\kv~\equiv~\cv/\cv^{\text{SM}}$, for the coupling between two Higgs bosons and one vector boson, and $\kvv~\equiv~\cvv/\cvv^{\text{SM}}$, a quartic coupling between two Higgs bosons and two vector bosons.

#+CAPTION: HH production cross section as a function of the coupling modifier $\kl$ for several production mechanisms. The dashed and solid lines denote respectively the \ac{LO} and \ac{NLO} predictions and the bands indicate the \ac{PDF} and scale uncertainties added linearly. The interference minima are not aligned for different production modes. For \ac{ggF} the cross-section is now known at \ac{NNLO} level with finite tio quark mass effects, while the figure displays the values for the \ac{NLO} FTapprox calculation. The figure is taken from [[cite:&HH_xsec_running]].

\end{alignat}

\noindent where $\mathcal{A}_{\triangle}$ and $\mathcal{A}_{\square}$ are the amplitudes of the triangle and box \ac{ggF} diagrams, respectively, and $\mathcal{I}_{\triangle\square}$ represents the interference term.


Variations of the coupling modifiers can also have a enormous impact on the shape of kinematical distributions.
Taking the mass of the HH system in [[fig:kl_c_EFT]] (left) as an example, we can see the \ac{SM} $\kl=1$ scenario can be completely altered by smaller or larger $\kl$ values.
Physically, and given the couplings present in the box and triangle diagrams, low $|\kl| \rightarrow 0$ corresponds to box dominated processes, while large $|\kl|$ values are ruled by triangle diagrams.
The larger visual variations occur for $\kl=2.45$, where the interference is maximal.
Although focusing on \ac{ggF}, it is worth noting that other production modes will also include interferences between different diagrams, as one could already see in [[fig:HH_prod_kl]].
The consequennce is clear: kinematic deviations represent a smoking gun for the presence of anomalous couplings.

Many \ac{BSM} models with \ac{SM}-compatible single Higgs boson signal strengths can exhibit a di-Higgs phenomenology vastly different from the \ac{SM} expectation.
In this sense, a successful discovery of Higgs boson pair production at the LHC and the subsequent measurement of potential deviations from the \ac{SM} constitute an important avenue in the search for physics beyond the \ac{SM}.

To facilitate such a measurement, it is crucial to establish the Higgs boson pair production cross section in the \ac{SM} to the best theoretical accuracy possible and to provide \ac{BSM} benchmarks that reflect the phenomenology of Higgs boson pairs at the LHC in a consistent and concise fashion.
