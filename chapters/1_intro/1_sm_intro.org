It all started with light!
Little did Thomson know, in 1897, that the observed deflection of a stream of charged particles by a magnet would be the seed for the gradual development of the theory explaining the interactions of all known fundamental particles.
Following the discovery of the electron, Rutherford famously demonstrated the structure of the atom, and soon after Bohr managed to develop a mathematical framework predicting the spectrum of Hydrogen.
Discoveries followed at a great pace: Chadwick's neutron, Planck's and Einstein's quantum.
Theoretical and experimental developments continued for half a century, facing frequent obstacles, but eventually reaching a surprisingly effective framework, capable of describing wildly diverse natural phenomena: from the core of an atom to interstellar space.
This overarching theory is known as the Standard Model of Particle Physics, sitting at the base of all scientific knowledge.






This section is responsible for introducing the \ac{SM}, covering its major aspects, especially whenever connected to later Chapters.
The \ac{SM} building blocks are coherently listed, serving as the starting point for the remaing sections.
It immediately follows a description of the far-reaching relationship between abstract symmetries and fundamental interactions, and its consequences on for the model under discussion.
This idea is corroborated an explanation of the Higgs mechanism, one of the revolutionary ideas defining the modern understanding of Particle Physics.
Having thus introduced the Higgs boson, we finalize the first Chapter by providing a concise account of the phenomenology and experimental status of Higgs physics: what quantities are worth measuring, and which results those measurements yielded.
