Little did Thomson know, in 1897, that the observed deflection of a stream of charged particles by a magnet would be the seed for the gradual development of the theory explaining the interactions of all known fundamental particles.
Following the discovery of the electron, Rutherford famously demonstrated the structure of the atom, and soon after Bohr managed to develop a mathematical framework predicting the spectrum of Hydrogen.
Discoveries followed at great pace: Chadwick's neutrons, Planck's and Einstein's quanta.
Theoretical and experimental developments continued for half a century, facing frequent obstacles, but eventually reaching a surprisingly effective framework, capable of describing wildly diverse natural phenomena: from the core of an atom to interstellar space.
This overarching theory is known as the Standard Model of Particle Physics, sitting at the base of all scientific knowledge.

This section provides a standard description of the \ac{SM}, covering its major aspects, focusing on the items most relevant for later sections.
The building blocks of the \ac{SM} are listed, hopefully providing a terse but clear picture of what is currently known at the most fundamental level.
It immediately follows a description of the far-reaching relationship between abstract symmetries and measurable interactions, and its impact on the development of the \ac{SM} as we know it.
Inconsistencies are elegantly solved in [[#sec:higgs_mechanism]], where the Higgs mechanism is discussed; a revolutionary idea defining the modern understanding of Particle Physics.
There, elementary particles acquire mass, and a new scalar is introduced, the Higgs boson, a central piece of the experimental programme of current high-energy collider experiments.
We finalize the first Chapter by presenting a concise account of the phenomenology and experimental status of Higgs physics: the quantities worth measuring, and the results such measurements have so far yielded.
