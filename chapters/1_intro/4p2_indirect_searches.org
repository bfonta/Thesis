On top of the already mentioned HH direct searches, $\kl$ can be alternatively constrained by the exploitation of single Higgs processes, such as \hzzfourl{} and \hgg{}.
Indeed, despite not depending on $\lh{3}$ at \ac{LO} or at higher orders in \ac{QCD}, single Higgs production does depend on $\kl$ in \ac{EW} interactions at \ac{NLO}.
We display some of those dependencies in [[fig:single_higgs_indirect_production]], for production, and [[fig:single_higgs_indirect_decay]], for decays [[cite:&indirect_searches1]].
Searches probing the Higgs self-coupling with higher-order loops are denoted /indirect/.
Single Higgs cross-sections can be quite sensitive to $\kl$ variations, especially in the \vh{} and \tth{} production modes, where up to 10% differences are expected [[cite:&indirect_searches2]].
The fact that a higher loop order is needed is in part counterbalanced by the much higher single Higgs cross section, leading to competitive limits with respect to HH production.
Having the same goal in mind, there has been an additional proposal, consisting on using processes with higher-order \ac{EW} diagrams, such as the ones used in $\mw$ and $\sint$ measurements [[cite:&indirect_searches_ew]].

Modifications of the Higgs self-coupling are parameterised with the $\kappa\text{-framework}$ presented in [[#sec:nonres_BSM_hh]], which is known to be equivalent to an \ac{EFT} approach with the introduction of higher-dimensional operators only affecting $\lh{3}$.
Additional sensitivity can be obtained by measuring differential cross sections, which do not have a flat dependence on $\kl$.
The transverse momentum \ac{pt} of the Higgs boson is found to be the most sensitive observable to detect \ac{BSM} effects on the trilinear coupling [[cite:&indirect_searches2;&modelling_single_h]].
The bounds obtained from indirect searches are competitive with the ones from double Higgs boson production [[cite:&indirect_searches3]], as shown in [[fig:direct_vs_indirect_cms]], and provide additional constraints for single Higgs couplings.
We describe in [[#sec:combinations]] the ample complementarity between single and double Higgs boson measurements.
