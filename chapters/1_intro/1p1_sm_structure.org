Out of the four known fundamental forces, three are described by the \ac{SM}: the \ac{EM}, the weak and the strong forces.
Electromagnetism is responsible for most natural phenomena we can readily perceive, such as friction, elasticity or drag, the color of the sky and how it changes during sunsets, from high-speed Maglev trains to impressive lightning storms.
The weak force is related to particle decays, and is fundamental for the nuclear fusion reactions that power the Sun.
The strong force is what keeps atoms and hadrons together.
Gravity is not integrated within the \ac{SM}, but it is by far the weakest of all forces, and can be safely ignored at the subatomic scales here discussed.

The three forces are represented by a \symfull{} local gauge symmetry, which is obeyed by the full \ac{SM} lagrangian.
The \symcolor{} group is generated by the mediators of the strong force, the gluons, described by \ac{QCD}.
The \symweak{} symmetry, instead, encompasses both the weak and \ac{EM} forces, respectively mediated by the W and Z vector bosons, and by the photon $\gamma$.
Particles are categorized according to their spin, being called bosons when possessing integer spin, or fermions when the spin is half-integer.
All mediators are bosons, and 12 exist in the \ac{SM}: 8 gluons plus the four mediators just mentioned.
In contrast, fermions comprise all ordinary matter and are exchanged by the mediators, being subdivided into quarks and leptons.
Twelve different fermionic fields are defined in the \ac{SM}, where half of those correspond to identical particles with opposite quantum numbers, \ie{} antiparticles.
Fermions are split across three generations, where each generation comprises either two quarks with electric charges $2/3$ and $-1/3$, or two leptons with charges $-1$ and $0$:

#+NAME: eq:quarks_and_leptons
\begin{equation}
\text{leptons:} \:\: \binom{\nu_{e}}{e} \: \binom{\nu_{\mu}}{\mu} \: \binom{\nu_{\tau}}{\tau} \: , \:\:\:\:\:\: \text{quarks:} \:\: \binom{u}{d} \: \binom{c}{s} \: \binom{t}{b}
\end{equation}

\noindent where each generation is arranged in a doublet, for reasons made clear when discussing the \ac{EW} interaction.
The $e$, $\mu$ and $\tau$ symbols for charged leptons refer to, respectively, electrons, muons and tau leptons.
They are identical except for their masses, which span multiple orders of magnitude: $m_{e}\approx511\,\si{\keV}$ cite:&electron_mass, $m_{\mu} \approx 105.7 \,\si{\MeV}$ cite:&electron_mass and $m_{\tau} \approx 1.8\,\si{\GeV}$ [[cite:&PDG]].
Contrary to electrons and muons, the tau lepton decays too fast for it to be observed at a collider experiment; we thus measure its decay products, which can be either leptons or hadrons, and covered in depth in [[#sec:physics_objects]].
The symbols $\nu_{e/\mu/\tau}$ refer instead to neutrinos and its three flavours, associated to the three leptons we just introduced.
Neutrinos do not have an electric or color charge, and thus interact solely via the weak force, being extremely hard to detect due to their tiny cross sections.
The most precise measurements of their near-zero masses set them at $< 0.8\,\si{\eV}$ [[cite:&katrin_neutrinos]], $< 0.17\,\si{\MeV}$ [[cite:&assamagan_neutrinos]], and $< 18.2\,\si{\MeV}$, for $\nu_{e}$, $\nu_{\mu}$ and $\nu_{\tau}$, respectively, but their sum is constrained to $\lesssim 0.15\,\si{\eV}$ [[cite:&PDG]].
It is however important to note that the three masses do not correspond to the three flavours, as they mix via the \ac{PMNS} matrix [[cite:&pmns]], leading to neutrino oscillations [[cite:&kamiokanade_neutrinos]].
All leptons interact via the \ac{EM} and weak forces, not possessing color charge.
On the contrary, quarks "feel" the three forces in the \ac{SM}, and are the internal constituents of hadrons: groups of two quarks are called mesons, groups of three are called baryons.
Quarks exist in 6 flavours, as represented in [[eq:quarks_and_leptons]]: up, down, charm, strange, top and bottom, all with different masses.
Due to the \ac{QCD} property of confinement, quarks cannot exist independently, and must be associated to other quarks, forming color-neutral bound states.
This is the basis of /hadronization/, described in [[#sec:offline_reco]] when discussing jets.
Bound states include protons and neutrons, which are made of up and down quarks in different proportions.
Hadrons with even more quarks have been observed, being all unstable.
Only the top quark cannot be part of hadrons, as it decays faster ($\tau_{t} \approx 0.5 \times 10^{-24}\,\si{\second}$ [[cite:&top_lifetime]]) than the time required to form a strong bound state.
Finally, thanks to a mechanism detailed in [[#sec:higgs_mechanism]], the scalar Higgs boson completes the collection of \ac{SM} particles, being responsible for all their masses.
The full "particle zoo" just described is illustrated in [[fig:sm_particles]], where antiparticles are not represented for simplicity.
