\Ac{CMS} can be found in the french village of Cessy, located \SI{100}{\meter} underground, and is undoubtedly one of the most complex scientific instruments ever built.
It derives its perceived "compactness" from a comparison with \ac{ATLAS}, since it is twice as small but twice as heavy.
Its acronym is also relate to two fundamental components of \ac{CMS}'s structure, namely an imposing \SI{4}{\tesla} solenoid magnet, and a large system of muon detectors which provide an exquisite muon resolution.
A community composed of almost 6300 people works for the success of \ac{CMS}, where approximately 2100 physicists, 1400 undergraduate students, 1200 PhD students and 1100 engineers are included.
The experiment spans five continents, with the involvement of 57 countries and regions, totaling 247 institutes at the time of writing.

The \ac{CMS} experiment was officially proposed in 1992, with the primary goals of discovering the Higgs boson and exploring \ac{BSM} physics at the \si{\TeV} scale.
Key to this objective were the \hzzfourl{} and \hgg{} physics channels, which required an excellent \ac{EM} calorimeter for effective electron and photon detection.
Nevertheless, all subdetectors in \ac{CMS} were designed to be versatile, and capable of measuring a wide range of physics processes across various energies, making \ac{CMS} truly a multi-purpose detector, as the more than 1000 diverse papers so far published can attest.

In this Section we start by defining the \ac{CMS} coordinate system which will be used across the remaining Chapters of this Thesis.
Next, a detailed description of individual components of \ac{CMS} is provided, since they represent the basis for understanding the trigger, reconstruction and simulation strategies later discussed.
