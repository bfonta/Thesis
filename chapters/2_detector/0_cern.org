Following the end of the Second World War, there was the need for Europe to stop the brain exodus to North America, and to establish a world-class research facility which could foster unity.
The European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) was thus born in 1954, engaging in purely scientific endeavors, and excluding itself, as per its Convention [[cite:&CERNconvention]], from any connection to military actions, in a spirit of peace and open scientific exchange.

Home of many atomic and particle physics experiments, CERN is nowadays widely known for its massive particle accelerator, the \ac{LHC}, built with a designed center-of-massy energy of \SI{14}{\TeV}.
The \ac{LHC} sits at the border between France and Switzerland, close to Geneva, and spans an impressive \SI{27}{\kilo\meter} ring of vacuum pipes, where beams of protons are accelerated in opposite directions almost at the speed of light.
The tunnel is located at a depth ranging between \num{45} and \SI{170}{\meter}, and was formerly used by \ac{LHC}'s predecessor, LEP, which provided the high-energy electron and positron beams leading to the precise measurements of the W and Z boson masses, among other \ac{SM} parameters.
The beams at the \ac{LHC} collide in four \acp{IP}, producing a myriad of decay products which are analyzed by large surrounding experiments.
One of such machines is known as CMS, and represents a general particle physics experiment producing the data which serves as basis for the thesis you are now reading.

This Chapter offers a condensed summary of the elements and ideas behind the data production flow taking place at the \ac{LHC} and \ac{CMS}, from circulating proton bunches to the definition of measured physics objects, expanding the current knowledge on subatomic physics.
We describe the \ac{LHC} in [[#sec:lhc_intro]] and \ac{CMS} in [[#sec:cms_detector]].
Given the scope of the thesis, namely the trigger work described in later chapters, we cover the \ac{CMS} trigger system in detail in [[#sec:cms_trigger_system]], and provide a concise description of how offline object reconstruction works in [[#sec:offline_reco]], giving special emphasis to the Particle Flow approach.
We finalize the Chapter by discussing Monte Carlo generation within \ac{CMS}, also in light of the Monte Carlo activities developed within the time-frame of the thesis here reported.
