\Ac{CMS} follows a right-handed coordinate system, where the origin is placed at the \ac{IP}.
Following the diagram in [[fig:coords2]], the $x\text{-axis}$ points towards the center of the \ac{LHC} ring, the $y\text{-axis}$ points vertically upward, and the $z\text{-axis}$ points towards the Jura mountains.
The cylindrical structure of \ac{CMS} naturally favors the use of a cylindrical coordinate system, given by:
#+NAME: eq:xyzcoords
\begin{equation}
\begin{cases}
x = \text{R} \sin \theta \cos \phi \\
y = \text{R} \sin \theta \sin \phi \\
z = \text{R} \cos \theta
\end{cases}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $x$, $y$ and $z$ are the standard 3D Cartesian coordinates, the radial coordinate is given by $\text{R}=\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$, the azimuthal angle $\phi$ is measured in the $x\text{-}y$ plane from the $x\text{-axis}$, and the polar angle $\theta$ is measured from the $z\text{-axis}$ in the $y\text{-}z$ plane.

To characterize particle interactions at the \ac{IP}, another quantity is often considered, namely the /rapidity/ of a particle:
#+NAME: eq:rapidity
\begin{equation}
\text{rapidity} = \frac{1}{2} \ln \left( \frac{E + p_z}{E - p_z} \right)
\end{equation}

\noindent where $E$ is the particle's energy and $p_z$ its longitudinal momentum.
A Lorentz-boost along the $z\text{-axis}$ shifts the rapidity by a constant term which depends on the boost itself.
This means that rapidity differences between pairs of particles are invariant with respect to Lorentz boosts along $z$.
In most \ac{HEP} \ac{pp} collisions, the distribution of final state particles is approximately uniform in rapidity [[cite:&pimenta]].
This explains why detector elements are often uniformly spaced in rapidity.

However, we note that, contrary to what happens in accelerators colliding fundamental particles, rapidity uniformity does not hold true for individual \ac{pp} collisions, given the partonic distributions within each colliding proton.
Different collisions can have wildly different rest frames.
Additionally, due to the absence of detector components along the longitudinal direction close to the beamline, which would interfere with the \ac{pp} beams, the momentum along the $z\text{-axis}$ remains unknown.
Most importantly, the momentum fraction carried along the $z\text{-axis}$ by each colliding parton is also unknown, as well as the longitudinal boost of the rest frame of the collision.
It is thus beneficial to use variables that do not depend on $p_z$, being also Lorentz-invariant for those longitudinal boosts.
The full energy and 3D momentum of a particle is thus replaced by the transverse momentum $p_\text{T}$ and the transverse mass $m_\text{T}$:
#+NAME: eq:transverse_momenta
\begin{equation}
\begin{cases}
p^2_{\text{T}} = p^2_x + p^2_y \\
m^2_{\text{T}} = m^2 + p^2_x + p^2_y = E^2 - p^2_z \:\:\: , \\
E^2_{\text{T}} = m^2 + p^2_{\text{T}} \\
\end{cases}
\end{equation}

\noindent where the transverse energy $E_{\text{T}}$ is defined based on the mass $m$ and transverse momentum.
For the same reasons, the rapidity of a particle is not easy to measure.
A new quantity is thus defined, dependent solely on the angle $\theta$ and illustrated in [[fig:coords1]] (left), called /pseudorapidity/, or $\eta$:
#+NAME: eq:pseudo-rapidity
\begin{equation}
\text{rapidity} \approx \frac{1}{2} \ln \left[ \frac{E(1 + \cos \theta)}{E(1 - \cos \theta)} \right]
= -\frac{1}{2} \ln \left[ \tan \left( \frac{\theta}{2} \right) \right]
\equiv \eta
\end{equation}

\noindent In the limit of large momenta, the rapidity and pseudorapidity become equal, but $y<\eta$ is always verified.
Differences of \ac{eta} are thus also Lorentz invariant for $p \gg m$.
Note that, despite the rapidity being finite, \ac{eta} can be infinite for particles produced at $\theta=0\si{\degree}$ or $\theta=180\si{\degree}$.
One can also use the above to define a Lorentz-invariant spatial separation between two particles, which will be often used in later chapters:
#+NAME: eq:deltar
\begin{equation}
\Delta\text{R} = \sqrt{(\Delta \eta)^2 + (\Delta \phi)^2}
\end{equation}

Due to mechanical limitations, subdetectors in \ac{HEP} are frequently split according to their $\eta$ coordinates, where the /barrel/ section stands for a central region with low $\eta$ values, and a /forward/ region or an /endcap/ refers to a high $|\eta|$ region, corresponding to the bases of the cylinder roughly defined by \ac{CMS}.
We show a visual conversion between $\theta$ and \ac{eta} values in [[fig:coords1]] (right), together with its inclusion in the full \ac{CMS} coordinate system.
