The \ac{LHC} is one of the largest scientific instruments ever built, being the current most powerful particle accelerator in the world.
Designed to provide a maximum center-of-mass energy of \SI{14}{\TeV}, it has gathered since its 2010 debut a user community of \num{\sim 9000} scientists working in fundamental particle physics [[cite:&hllhc]].
One of the main scientific driving factors to built such a powerful and expensive machine was to search for the conjectured Higgs boson and understand the mechanism of \ac{EWSB}, which we covered in [[#sec:higgs_mechanism]].
The \ac{LHC} is also intended to explore the $\si{TeV}$ scale, either via the existence of new resonances, or by the indirect manifestation of higher-energy and yet unknown particles, in order to answer some of the most profound questions in modern physics.
Beyond its \ac{pp} collisions, the \ac{LHC} also collides heavy ions, like \ch{Pb} or \ch{Xe}, enabling the study of the /quark-gluon plasma/, an extremely dense and hot state of matter where quarks and gluons do not experience the strong force.
In the following, we cover \ac{LHC}'s design and operations, and briefly describe some of its most iconic active experiments.
