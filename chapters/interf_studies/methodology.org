In the real singlet model, for $\mx > 2 \mh$, the width of the resonance X is given by:

#+NAME: eq:width
\begin{equation}
\Gamma_{\text{X}} = \sin^{2}\alpha\,\Gamma^{\text{SM}}(\mx) + \Gamma_{\text{X} \rightarrow \text{HH}} \equiv \sin^{2}\alpha\,\Gamma^{\text{SM}}(\mx) + \frac{\lhhx^{2}\sqrt{1 - 4\mh^{2}/\mx^{2}}}{8\pi \mx} \:\: ,
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\lhhx$ is the trilinear coupling between two H bosons and the new particle X, and $\Gamma^{\text{SM}}(\mx)$ represents the width of a scalar boson of mass $\mx$ with the same decay modes of the \ac{SM} H boson.
The latter has been calculated by interpolating the values published in [[cite:&YellowReport4]] and is shown in [[fig:single_model_scan]] (left).
In addition to $\alpha$, $\mx$ and $\lhhx$, this singlet model also depends on the trilinear H coupling modifier $\kl \equiv \lambda_{\text{HHH}}/\lambda^{\text{SM}}_{\text{HHH}}$, and on an additional scalar coupling.
The values of the branching ratio of \xhh{} with respect to the entire phase-space of the particle X are encoded by $\Gamma_{\text{X} \rightarrow \text{H}\text{H}}/\Gamma_{\text{X}}$ and displayed in [[fig:single_model_scan]] for two values of $\mx$, as a function of $\sina$ and $\lhhx$.
The plots are meant to provide an idea of the range of parameters considered, and how they affect $\Gamma_{\text{X}}$.
In particular, notice that, as expected, $\mathcal{B}(\text{X} \rightarrow \text{H}\text{H})$ is zero along the $\lhhx=0$ horizontal line, as no coupling exists connecting the H and X sectors.
On the contrary, $\mathcal{B}(\text{X} \rightarrow \text{H}\text{H})$ is always one along the $\sina=0$ ($\cos(\alpha)=1$) vertical line, since in that case X does not couple to any \ac{SM} particle and thus can only decay to a Higgs boson pair.
Also note how the branching ratio changes with increasing $\mx$, given the extremely significant increase of $\Gamma^{\text{SM}}(\mx)$ with the resonance mass.

The point at $\sina = 0$ and $\lhhx = 0\,\si{\GeV}$ corresponds to the \ac{SM} scenario, where [[eq:width]] is not well defined.

We use the =MADGRAPH5_aMC@NLO= generator, version 2.9.7 [[cite:&madgraph]], to simulate inclusive HH events in the singlet model at \ac{LO}. 
A custom \ac{UFO} [[cite:&feynrules]] model based on [[cite:&papa1]] adds a heavy scalar boson to the \ac{SM} with couplings to \ac{SM} particles as defined in [[eq:singlet_couplings]], following what is described in [[#sec:singlet_model]].
The samples are created according to the following parameter grid, using $\kl = 1$:
+ $\mx$ [\si{\GeV}]: \num{280}, \num{300}, \num{400}, \num{500}, \num{600}, \num{700}, \num{800}, \num{900}, \num{1000};
+ $\sina$: \num{0.00}, \num{0.10}, \num{0.20}, \num{0.30}, \num{0.40}, \num{0.50}, \num{0.60}, \num{0.70}, \num{0.80}, \num{0.90}, \num{0.95}, \num{0.99};
+ $\lhhx$ [\si{\GeV}]: \num{-600}, \num{-500}, \num{-400}, \num{-300}, \num{-200}, \num{-100}, \num{-50}, \num{0}, \num{50}, \num{100}, \num{200}, \num{300}, \num{400}, \num{500}, \num{600}.

\noindent The values of $\mx$ are chosen based on the signal samples used in the HH combination presented in [[#sec:prospects_res]].
The resonant, nonresonant, and total HH cross sections in the singlet model for each combination of grid points are generated separately, to what amounts to a very computing intensive task, with the parallel generation of \num{4860} grid points.
The nonresonant cross section is obtained by setting the $g_{\text{X} kk}$ coupling in [[eq:singlet_couplings]] to zero, and the resonant-only cross section by setting $g_{\text{H} kk}$ to zero.
We perform parameter scans in $\mx$, $\sina$, and $\lhhx$ for the three cross-sections above, and additionally for the /interference ratio/, defined as:

#+NAME: eq:rint
\begin{equation}
\rint = \frac{\sigma^{\text{total}} - \left(\sigma^{\text{resonant-only}} + \sigma^{\text{nonresonant}}  \right)}{\sigma^{\text{resonant-only}} + \sigma^{\text{nonresonant}}} \:\: .
\end{equation}

\noindent The variable $\rint$ provides information concerning the relative strength of the interference between the SM and BSM processes.
When no interference is present, the total cross-section is equal to the sum of its resonant and nonresonant components.
The larger the deviation of $\rint$ from zero, the stronger the modification of the cross section due to the interference.
We consider the \ac{ggF} production mode due to its dominant contribution to the cross section.
Some total cross-section scans are shown in [[fig:maps_2d]], where two-dimensional histograms containing the total cross-section as a function of $\sina$ and $\lhhx$ are displayed for four $\mx$ values.
The \ac{UFO} model and procedure are validated using the program =hpair= [[cite:&Grober1;&Grober2]] where $\kl\text{-dependent}$ results in the nonresonant scenario are found to agree with the \ac{NLO} predictions of [[cite:&higgs_10_years]].

#+NAME: fig:maps_2d
#+CAPTION: Two-dimensional maps for the total cross section of the singlet model described in [[#sec:singlet_model]], as a function of $\sina$ and $\lhhx$, for $\mx{} = 280\,\si{\GeV}$ (top left), $\mx{} = 400\,\si{\GeV}$ (top right), $\mx{} = 600\,\si{\GeV}$ (bottom left) and $\mx{} = 800\,\si{\GeV}$ (bottom right). Similar maps were obtained for all other $\mx$ values mentioned in the text. Similar maps for the interference ratios ([[eq:rint]]) are later used to draw contour maps for singlet model phase-space regions that are excluded with current HH measurements.
