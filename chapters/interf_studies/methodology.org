Most of the HH and YH analyses performed by \ac{CMS} make use of the \ac{NWA}, where the width of \ac{BSM} particles is neglected and no interference with nonresonant Higgs boson pair production occurs.
However, in general, interference effects can strongly impact the HH cross section.
The interference can be either constructive or destructive, enhancing or decreasing the HH rate [[cite:&CarenaWidthEnhancement;&Grober2017gut]], and have a nonnegligible effect in \ac{BSM} exclusion limits.
We study the impact of the interference between nonresonant and resonant production in the inclusive \pphh{} production, which can receive contributions from resonant \xhh{} production. 
This work provides the first measure of interference effects, identifying phase space regions where the \ac{NWA} is valid.
We use as a benchmark a simplified scenario based on the real-singlet model introduced in [[#sec:singlet_model]], as it includes the smallest number of additional free parameters [[cite:&OConnell2006rsp]].
We note that interference effects are model dependent and may be different for other \ac{BSM} scenarios.

For this specific study, we modify the singlet model by not imposing the \ztwo{} symmetry. 
The \ztwo{} symmetry precludes terms of odd powers of the additional singlet scalar field, which are known to be responsible for a stronger first-order \ac{EW} phase transition [[cite:&papa1;&papa2]].
Exploiting \ac{EW} symmetry breaking on the singlet model scalar potential, we are left with two mixing states.
After mass diagonalization, the identification of one of the states with the \ac{SM} H boson reduces the number of uncorrelated parameters further from seven to five. 
The other state is associated with a new particle X. 
The couplings of the H boson and the X particle are given by

#+NAME: eq:singlet_couplings
\begin{equation}
g_{\text{H} kk} = g^{\text{SM}}_{\text{H} kk}\cos\alpha \quad \text{and} \quad g_{\text{X} kk} = -g^{\text{SM}}_{\text{H} kk}\sin\alpha, 
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\alpha$ is the mixing angle, and $k$ represents any SM particle.
For $\mx > 2 \mh$ the width of the X resonance can be calculated as:

#+NAME: eq:width
\begin{equation}
\Gamma_{\text{X}} = \sin^{2}\alpha\,\Gamma^{\text{SM}}(\mx) + \frac{\lhhx^{2}\sqrt{1 - 4m_{\mh}^{2}/\mx^{2}}}{8\pi \mx},
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\lhhx$ is the trilinear coupling between two H bosons and the new particle X, and $\Gamma^{\text{SM}}(\mx)$ represents the width of a scalar boson of mass $\mx$ with the same decay modes as the \ac{SM} H boson.
The latter has been calculated by interpolating the values published in [[cite:&YellowReport4]]. 
In addition to $\alpha$, $\mx$ and $\lhhx$, this singlet model also depends on the trilinear H coupling $\kl \equiv \lambda_{\text{HHH}}/\lambda^{\text{SM}}_{\text{HHH}}$, and on an additional scalar coupling.

We use the =MADGRAPH5_aMC@NLO= generator version 2.9.7 [[cite:&madgraph]], to simulate inclusive HH events in the singlet model at \ac{LO}. 
A custom \ac{UFO} [[cite:&feynrules]] model based on [[cite:&papa1]] adds a heavy scalar boson to the \ac{SM} with couplings to \ac{SM} particles as defined in [[eq:singlet_couplings]].
The samples are created according to the following parameter grid with $\kl = 1$:
+ $\mx$ [\si{\GeV}]: \num{280}, \num{300}, \num{400}, \num{500}, \num{600}, \num{700}, \num{800}, \num{900}, \num{1000}, 
+ $\sina$: \num{0.00}, \num{0.10}, \num{0.20}, \num{0.30}, \num{0.40}, \num{0.50}, \num{0.60}, \num{0.70}, \num{0.80}, \num{0.90}, \num{0.95}, \num{0.99}, 
+ $\lhhx$ [\si{\GeV}]: \num{-600}, \num{-500}, \num{-400}, \num{-300}, \num{-200}, \num{-100}, \num{-50}, \num{0}, \num{50}, \num{100}, \num{200}, \num{300}, \num{400}, \num{500}, \num{600}, 

\noindent where $\mx$ is chosen based on the signal samples used in the HH combination presented in @combination@.
The resonant, nonresonant, and total cross sections for each combination of grid points are generated separately.
We perform a parameter scan in the parameters $\mx$, $\sina$, and $\lhhx$ of the interference ratio defined as:

#+NAME: eq:rint
\begin{equation}
\rint = \frac{\sigma^{\text{full}} - \left(\sigma^{\text{resonant-only}} + \sigma^{\text{nonresonant}}  \right)}{\sigma^{\text{resonant-only}} + \sigma^{\text{nonresonant}}}.
\end{equation}

We obtain the nonresonant cross section by setting the coupling $g_{\text{X} kk}$ defined in [[eq:singlet_couplings]] to zero, 
and the resonant-only cross section by setting the coupling $g_{\text{H} kk}$ to zero. 
The variable $\rint$ provides information concerning the relative strength of the interference between the SM and 
BSM processes. The larger the deviation of $\rint$ from zero, the stronger the modification of the cross 
section due to the interference. We consider the gluon fusion production mode due to its dominant contribution 
to the cross section.
The \ac{UFO} model and procedure are validated using the program =hpair= [[cite:&Grober1;&Grober2]] where the results varying $\kl$ in the nonresonant scenario are found to agree with the \ac{NLO} predictions of [[cite:&higgs_10_years]].
