# Most of the HH and YH analyses performed by \ac{CMS} make use of the \ac{NWA}, 
# where the width of BSM particles is neglected and no interference with nonresonant 
# Higgs boson pair production occurs.
# However, in general, interference effects can strongly impact 
# the \HH cross section~\cite{Heinemeyer:2024hxa,Basler:2019nas}.
# The interference can be either constructive or destructive, enhancing or decreasing the \HH 
# production rate~\cite{Carena:2018vpt,Grober:2017gut}, and have a nonnegligible effect 
# in BSM exclusion limits.
# We study the impact of the interference between nonresonant and resonant production in 
# the inclusive $\pp\to\HH$ production, which can receive contributions from resonant $\PX\to\HH$ production. 
# This work provides the first measure of interference effects, identifying phase space regions 
# where the NWA is valid.
# We use as a benchmark a simplified scenario based on the real-singlet model introduced in 
# Section~\ref{Sec:AdditionalSinglets}, as it includes the smallest number of additional free 
# parameters~\cite{OConnell:2006rsp}.
# We note that interference effects are model dependent and may be different for other BSM scenarios.

# For this specific study, we modify the singlet model by not imposing the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry. 
# The $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry precludes terms of odd powers of the additional singlet scalar field, which are known 
# to be responsible for a stronger first-order EW phase transition~\cite{Papaefstathiou:2020iag,Papaefstathiou:2021glr}.
# Exploiting EW symmetry breaking on the singlet model scalar potential, we are left with two mixing states.
# After mass diagonalization, the identification of one of the states with the SM \PH boson 
# reduces the number of uncorrelated parameters further from seven to five. 
# The other state is associated with a new particle \PX. 
# The couplings of the \PH boson and the \PX particle are given by
# \begin{equation}
#   \label{eq:singlet_couplings}
#   g_{\PH kk} = g^{\text{SM}}_{\PH kk}\cos\alpha \quad \text{and} \quad g_{\PX kk} = -g^{\text{SM}}_{\PH kk}\sin\alpha, 
# \end{equation}
# where $\alpha$ is the mixing angle, and $k$ represents any SM particle.
# For $\mX > 2 \mH$ the width of the \PX resonance can be calculated as 
# \begin{equation}
#   \label{eq:width}
#   \widthGamma = \sin^{2}\alpha\,\Gamma^{\text{SM}}(m_{\PX}) + \frac{\lambda_{\HH\PX}^{2}\sqrt{1 - 4m_{\PH}^{2}/m_{\PX}^{2}}}{8\pi m_{\PX}},
# \end{equation}
# where \couplingLambda is the trilinear coupling between two \PH bosons and the new particle \PX, 
# and $\Gamma^{\text{SM}}(m_{\PX})$ represents the width of a scalar boson of mass \mX with the same 
# decay modes as the SM \PH boson.
# The latter has been calculated by interpolating the values published in Ref.~\cite{deFlorian:2016spz}. 
# In addition to $\alpha$, \mX and \couplingLambda, this singlet model also depends on the trilinear 
# \PH coupling modifier $\kappaLambda \equiv \lambda_{\PH\PH\PH}/\lambda^{\text{SM}}_{\PH\PH\PH}$, and on an additional scalar coupling.

# We use the \MGvATNLO generator version 2.9.7~\cite{Alwall:2014hca}, 
# to simulate inclusive \HH events in the singlet model at LO. 
# A custom universal \textsc{FeynRules}~\cite{FeynRules} output (UFO) model based on Ref.~\cite{Papaefstathiou:2020iag} 
# adds a heavy scalar boson to the SM with couplings to SM particles as defined in Eq.~\eqref{eq:singlet_couplings}.
# The samples are created according to the following parameter grid with $\kappaLambda = 1$:
# \begin{itemize}
#   \item \mX [\!\GeV{}]: 280, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900, 1000, 
#   \item $\sin\alpha$: 0.00, 0.10, 0.20, 0.30, 0.40, 0.50, 0.60, 0.70, 0.80, 0.90, 0.95, 0.99, 
#   \item \couplingLambda [\!\GeV{}]: $-$600, $-$500, $-$400, $-$300, $-$200, $-$100, $-$50, 0, 50, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 
# \end{itemize}
# where \mX is chosen based on the signal samples used in the \HH combination presented in Section~\ref{Sec:Results_X_to_HH}.
# The resonant, nonresonant, and total cross sections for each combination of grid points are generated separately.
# We perform a parameter scan in the parameters \mX, $\sin\alpha$, and \couplingLambda of the interference ratio defined as 
# \begin{equation}\label{eq:Rint}
#   \Rint = \frac{\sigma^{\text{full}} - \left(\sigma^{\text{resonant-only}} + \sigma^{\text{nonresonant}}  \right)}{\sigma^{\text{resonant-only}} + \sigma^{\text{nonresonant}}}.
# \end{equation}
# We obtain the nonresonant cross section by setting the coupling $g_{\PX kk}$ defined in Eq.~\eqref{eq:singlet_couplings} to zero, 
# and the resonant-only cross section by setting the coupling $g_{\PH kk}$ to zero. 
# The variable \Rint provides information concerning the relative strength of the interference between the SM and 
# BSM processes. The larger the deviation of \Rint from zero, the stronger the modification of the cross 
# section due to the interference. We consider the gluon fusion production mode due to its dominant contribution 
# to the cross section.
# The UFO model and procedure are validated using the program \textsc{hpair}~\cite{Grober:2015cwa, Grober:2017gut}
# where the results varying \kappaLambda in the nonresonant scenario are found to agree with the 
# NLO predictions of Ref.~\cite{CMS:2022dwd}.

# Exact conclusions from this study naturally depend on the allowed size of \Rint and the relative width \widthRatio. 
# In the following, we choose as benchmark points $\Rint=\pm10$ and $\pm20\%$, and $\widthRatio=5$, 10 and 20\%.
# The corresponding contours and exclusion limits derived from the \HH combination in the singlet 
# model are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:extSec_singlet}. 

# Contours of positive and negative interference ratios are shown in
# green (for $\Rint=\pm10\%$) and blue (for $\Rint=\pm20\%$). They are found to
# swap positions at $\mX = 400\GeV$, likely because of the peak of the nonresonant \HH distribution.
# The dotted lines denote coupling value combinations beyond which 
# the relative width of the resonance, $\Gamma_{\PX}/\mX$, exceeds 5
# and 10\%, respectively, implying the narrow width 
# approximation not being accurate anymore.   
# For a given \mX, the quadratic dependence of \widthGamma on both $\sin\alpha$ and \couplingLambda 
# according to Eq.~\eqref{eq:width} leads to elliptical isolines of constant \widthRatio. 
# The experimental bound from the \HH combination discussed in Section~\ref{Sec:Results_X_to_HH} 
# is obtained from the 95\% \CL upper limit on $\sigma(\pp\to\PX)\BR(\PX\to\HH)$, 
# with the \PX production cross section growing with increasing $\sin\alpha$, 
# and $\BR(\PX\to\HH)$ growing with increasing \couplingLambda.
# We note that large values of $\sin\alpha$, corresponding to regions where the \PH boson is less SM-like, 
# also tend to be excluded by precision measurements of the \PH boson.

# For most of the studied mass points, sizable interference ratios occur
# only in parameter regions to which the current measurements are either
# not yet sensitive, or at too large values of $\sin\alpha$. In
# particular, for large resonance masses, where interference effects tend
# to grow, they are far below the current sensitivity and might only
# play a role when the full data set from HL-LHC becomes
# available~\cite{Cepeda:2019klc}, as discussed in
# Sec.~\ref{Sec:DiscoveryPotential_X_to_YH}. However, there are
# regions at intermediate \mX where the interpretation of NWA-based
# limits for \HH derived in the singlet model would solicit some care
# already in the Run~2 combination (\eg $\mX = 500\GeV$, $\sin\alpha =
# 0.2$ and $\couplingLambda = 400\GeV$). It is important to note that
# such interpretations are generally model dependent.

# The differential cross sections as a function of \mHH are shown for representative points from 
# the ($\sin\alpha$, \couplingLambda) parameter space in 
# Fig.~\ref{fig:lineshapes-280GeV} for $\mX=280\GeV$, and in Fig.~\ref{fig:lineshapes-500GeV} for $\mX=500\GeV$. 
# The parameters are chosen such that $\widthRatio = 5\%$, which is well below the detector resolution for resonance masses below 1~\TeV,
# and $\Rint=\pm10\%$ or $\pm20\%$, so that sizable interference effects are expected. 
# The lineshapes show points in parameter space where the \Rint contours intersect with lines of 
# constant $\widthRatio = 5\%$ in Fig.~\ref{fig:extSec_singlet}. 

# The mass points of $\mX=280$ and 500\GeV have been chosen because these values are 
# on the left- and right-hand side of the peak in the \mHH distribution for nonresonant SM \HH production. 
# The total signal contribution of the resonance, including the interference effect, 
# can be assessed as the difference between $\sigma^{\text{full}}$ (red graph) and $\sigma^{\text{nonresonant}}$ (green graph).
# In the $\mX=280\GeV$ case, the resonance peak is at a mass where the non-resonant background is low in comparison; hence the central part of the peak is not much affected in its shape, and a classical bump hunt should still work. However, the total cross section is modified as specified by $\Rint$. For a precision measurement, which is not yet in our reach, a distortion of the signal shape, either a peak-dip or peak-tail pattern depending on the relative sign of the amplitudes, would have to be taken into account.
# At $\mX=500\GeV$, in the top panels of Fig.~\ref{fig:lineshapes-500GeV}, the signal shape is found to be strongly modified by the interference effect. However, this occurs in a parameter region still relatively far away from the regions currently probed, as can be appreciated in Fig.~\ref{fig:extSec_singlet}. 
# Although the expected interference effects clearly depend on the underlying model, 
# they can be expected to be of mounting importance in the future as the LHC data set increases.
