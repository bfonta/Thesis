An important point under investigation is to know whether the scalar sector realized in nature corresponds to the \ac{SM}.
Despite the remarkable success of the \ac{SM} so far, many \ac{BSM} physics predicts the existence of additional scalars, which could be singlets, doublets, or any other multiplets under the \ac{EW} gauge group.
Such extensions typically come with additional \ac{BSM} particles.
Intuitively, such models nevertheless have to obey the constraints set from both theory and experiments [[cite:&singlet_model_robens]].

In this chapter we focus on the \ac{SM} extended by a real singlet scalar field X.
The most general form of the Higgs scalar potential $V$ becomes:

#+NAME: eq:singlet_couplings
\begin{equation}
V(\text{H}, \text{X}) = \mu^{2} (\text{H}^{\dagger} \text{H}) + \frac{1}{2} (\text{H}^{\dagger} \text{H})^{2} + c_{1}(\text{H}^{\dagger} \text{H})\text{X} + \frac{c_{2}}{2}(\text{H}^{\dagger} \text{H})\text{X}^{2} + \frac{\mx^{2}}{2}\text{X}^{2} + \frac{\kappa}{3}\text{S}^{3} + \frac{\lhhx}{2}\text{S}^{4}
\end{equation}



One question currently of high interest is whether new physics will enable a \ac{SFO-EWPT} phase transition.
In general, this is studied in the context of exotic Higgs decays.
However, one can also test this in models where the second scalar is heavier than the 125 GeV resonance.
The hardest constraint on $\sin(\theta)$ comes from the measurements of the W mass @talk about current efforts to measure the W mass@

The additional scalar boson X predicted in the real-singlet model has the same relative couplings to SM particles as the SM H boson. Most searches for X → HH assume that the width of the X boson is much smaller than the reconstructed mass resolution, such that the NWA holds.
We use the real-singlet model for a dedicated study of nonnegligible width and interference effects and present the results in Section 4.4. The corresponding model interpretations for the X → HH combination in the real-singlet model are presented there.




For this specific study, we modify the singlet model by not imposing the \ztwo{} symmetry. 
The \ztwo{} symmetry precludes terms of odd powers of the additional singlet scalar field, which are known to be responsible for a stronger first-order \ac{EW} phase transition [[cite:&papa1;&papa2]].
Exploiting \ac{EW} symmetry breaking on the singlet model scalar potential, we are left with two mixing states.
After mass diagonalization, the identification of one of the states with the \ac{SM} H boson reduces the number of uncorrelated parameters further from seven to five. 
The other state is associated with a new particle X. 
The couplings of the H boson and the X particle are given by

#+NAME: eq:singlet_couplings
\begin{equation}
g_{\text{H} kk} = g^{\text{SM}}_{\text{H} kk}\cos\alpha \quad \text{and} \quad g_{\text{X} kk} = -g^{\text{SM}}_{\text{H} kk}\sin\alpha, 
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\alpha$ is the mixing angle, and $k$ represents any SM particle.
