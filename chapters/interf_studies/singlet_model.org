One important question is to investigate whether the scalar sector realized in nature corresponds indeed to the SM, or whether it
is enhanced by additional scalars, which can be singlets, doublets, or any other multiplets under the electroweak gauge group
Such extensions then typically come with additional particle content, i.e. additional neutral or charged scalars which can also differ by their CP properties.
Naturally, such models then need to obey current constraints from both theory and experiment, as e.g. stabilization conditions for the vacuum, positivity, perturbativity, and constraints from direct searches, signal strength, or electroweak precision observables.

One question currently of high interest is whether new physics will enable a strong first-order electroweak phase transition. In general, this is studied in the context of exotic Higgs decays.
However, one can also test this in models where the second scalar is heavier than the 125 GeV resonance.
The hardest constraint on $\sin(\theta)$ comes from the measurements of the W mass @talk about current efforts to measure the W mass@

The additional scalar boson X predicted in the real-singlet model has the same relative couplings to SM particles as the SM H boson. Most searches for X → HH assume that the width of the X boson is much smaller than the reconstructed mass resolution, such that the NWA holds.
We use the real-singlet model for a dedicated study of nonnegligible width and interference effects and present the results in Section 4.4. The corresponding model interpretations for the X → HH combination in the real-singlet model are presented there.
