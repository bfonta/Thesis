As discussed in [[#sec:short_comings]], despite the impressive success of the \ac{SM}, we know that it must be incomplete.
One of the big questions still left unanswered relates to the nature of the \ac{EWSB} of the Higgs field.
When the Universe was very young, at extremely high temperatures, it was energetically favourable for the Higgs field to be zero everywhere.
Only around a hundred picoseconds after the Big Bang, with a stark temperature drop, was the symmetry broken.
It is currently unknown how \ac{EWSB} takes place, specifically which kind of phase transition drives it.
According to the \ac{SM}, the crossover should be smooth [[cite:&ewpt_type]], but such scenario is considered unnatural by some, due to the extreme distance between \ac{EW} and Planck scales.
A \ac{SFO-EWPT} would point to \ac{BSM} effects, producing signatures that can be detected in next-generation space interferometers, such as LISA [[cite:&lisa]] (already validated by the LISA Pathfinder [[cite:&lisapathfinder]]) or the similar Decigo experiment [[cite:&decigo]].
Some \ac{BSM} models, including the singlet model discussed in [[#sec:singlet_model]], can create the required conditions to enable a \ac{SFO-EWPT}, which can notably also explain baryogenesis.
In particular, new states can modify the Higgs potential and its dependence on temperature, potentially introducing false, metastable vacua.
The false potential minima would allow sudden phase transitions via the sci-fi-esque coalescence of vacuum bubbles[fn:: Vaccum decay, with the creation of vaccum bubbles, might destroy the Universe as we know it [[cite:&coleman;&coleman_luccia]]!].
It is however important to note that, based on current $\mt$ and $\alpha_{\text{S}}$ constraints [[cite:&vacuum_stability_2024]], our Universe could be metastable without additional states.
The stability conditions are ruled by the running of the self-coupling with energy, in a function that also depends on the Higgs boson and top quark masses.
For $\lh{3}$ at a certain energy scale, quantum tunneling from the current potential minimum to a lower minimum becomes possible.
In [[fig:dead_or_alive]] we can see measurements of $\mt$ and $\mh$ overlayed on stability regions.
The current measurements seems to favour a scenario where the tunneling probability timescale is comparable to or longer than the age of the Universe, while remaining meta-stable.
Despite the absence of a one-to-one correspondence between $\lh{3}$ and the vacuum instability, the measurement of the self-coupling could nevertheless shed light on whether the long-term existence of the electroweak vacuum is not guaranteed in Nature, or if a yet unknown mechanism ensures stability [[cite:&cadamuro_review]].
We again point out the importance of HH production in the possible observation of variations of the Higgs potential, which might be connected to \ac{EWPT}, elucidating the matter-antimatter asymmetry experienced in our Universe [[cite:&hllhc_physics]]
[[cite:&vacuum_stability_2024]].

(Left) Zoomed-out version. (Right) Zoomed-in version, also displaying the measured $\mh$ and $\mt$ experimental range, where the gray areas denote the allowed regions with their 1, 2 and \SI{3}{\sigma} countours. The color gradient indicates the size of the theoretical uncertainties. Taken from [[cite:&vacuum_stab]].
