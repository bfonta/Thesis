As discussed in [[#sec:short_comings]], despite the impressive success of the \ac{SM}, we know that it must be incomplete.
One of the big questions still left unanswered relates to the nature of the \ac{EWSB} brought by the Higgs field.
When the Universe was very young, at extremely high temperatures, it was energetically favourable for the Higgs field to be zero everywhere.
Only around a hundred picoseconds after the Big Bang, with a stark temperature drop, was the symmetry broken.
It is currently unknown how \ac{EWSB} takes place, specifically which kind of phase transition drives it.
According to the \ac{SM}, the crossover should be smooth [[cite:&ewpt_type]], but such scenario is considered unnatural by some, due to the extreme distance between \ac{EW} and Planck scales.
A \ac{SFO-EWPT} would point to \ac{BSM} effects, producing signatures that can be detected in next-generation space interferometers, such as the exciting \ac{LISA} [[cite:&lisa]] experiment (already validated by \ac{LISA} Pathfinder [[cite:&lisapathfinder]]) or the similar \ac{Decigo} experiment [[cite:&decigo]].
The conditions necessary to require a \ac{SFO-EWPT} can notably explain baryogenesis.
In particular, new states can modify the Higgs potential and its dependence on temperature, potentially introducing false, metastable vacua.
These would allow sudden phase transitions via the sci-fi-esque coalescence of vacuum bubbles[fn:: Vaccum decay, with the creation of vaccum bubbles, might destroy the Universe as we know it [[cite:&coleman;&coleman_luccia]]!].
We again point out the importance of HH production in the possible observation of variations of the Higgs potential, which might be connected to \ac{EWPT}, elucidating the matter-antimatter asymmetry experienced in our Universe [[cite:&hllhc_physics]].
