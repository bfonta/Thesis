#+NAME: fig:cross_trigger_ex
#+CAPTION: Simplified illustration of the increased acceptance brought by a cross trigger. We shows the $\pt(\ell)$ vs. $\pt(\tau_{\text{h}})$ phase-space, with $\ell$ representing an electron or a muon. In blue we depict the region covered by the single lepton trigger, while in red we highlight the region added by the cross trigger. The dashed lines and arrows indicate the regions covered by the respective triggers. The additional tau leg in the cross trigger enables to decrease the lepton leg threshold, relative to the single trigger. Triggers also depend on other variables, making a realistic multi-dimensional picture more complex.

In the 2016 analysis, a single \ac{HLT} path targets each channel: a trigger requiring one electron for the \eletau{} topology, another trigger requiring a muon for \mutau{}, and a \ditau{} trigger for the \tautau{} channel.
Cross trigger paths are then added to the semi-leptonic channels, following what was done in the nonresonant \bbtt{} analysis of \newcite{higgs_bbtautau_nonres}.
By "cross" we refer to triggers applying a \logicand{} on two different object types, so-called /trigger legs/: electron and tau for \eletau{}, muon and tau for \mutau{}.
These new triggers enlarge the analysis' phase-space, as shown in [[fig:cross_trigger_ex]], in terms of the \ac{pt} thresholds considered.
We call /legacy triggers/ the set of triggers that has already been used in previous analysis iterations, and list them for the three analysis channels in [[ref:tab:trigger_etau,tab:trigger_mutau,tab:trigger_tautau]].
The region covered by those triggers is accordingly named /legacy region/.
Additionally, the \mumu{} channel, despite not being exploited for the final results, is nevertheless used for defining a \ac{CR} and for extracting \ac{MET} trigger \acp{SF} as explained in [[#sec:met_trigger_sfs]].
The \mumu{} triggers are thus shown in [[tab:trigger_mumu]], corresponding to a subset of the triggers used for the \mutau{} channel.

Concerning the \eletau{} channel, which triggers are listed in [[tab:trigger_etau]], isolation selections are applied to the electron legs, using a Tight \ac{WP}.
The isolation is defined based on the amount of calorimetric energy surrounding the $e/\gamma$ \ac{L1} candidate.
Additionally, an $|\eta|<2.1$ cut is occasionally applied to avoid the high rates close to the beamline.
The electron can be joined to a tau leg, where analogous but tighter cuts are applied, given the higher rates.
Concerning [[tab:trigger_mutau]], which covers the \mutau{} channel, we can see that two types of muon isolation are defined.
The first uses energy information from the two \ac{CMS} calorimeters; the second exploits reconstructed tracks close to the muon.
The muon can be also connected to a hadronic tau leg, forming another cross-trigger.
The difference in \ac{pt} thresholds between the electron and muon triggers is an indication of the excquisite muon \ac{ID} capabilities in \ac{CMS}.
Finally, for [[tab:trigger_tautau]], we observe similar requirements as in the tau legs above, but with necessarily tighter cuts.
Indeed, tau leptons are often faked by other physics objects, and their rates are thus harder to control, given the available trigger bandwidth.
This explains why no \stau{} trigger had been so far considered in the legacy region: \ac{pt} thresholds are too large, and cannot reach the \ac{pt} regions covered by the \ditau{} triggers.
A description of the algorithms used to reconstruct tau leptons and of how their isolation is computed is available in [[#sec:offline_reco_taus]].
