The offline data events are recorded with a set of \ac{L1}+\ac{HLT} triggers directly related to the analysis decay channels.
The goal is to minimise the number of \hhbbtt{} events lost, extending the analysis acceptance.
This is why modern analyses often consider a large set of different \ac{HLT} trigger paths, since every bit of acceptance increase matters, especially for processes as rare as double Higgs production.
This idea remains true for the present /resonant/ search, given that more events tends to equate to more stringent exclusion limits.
However, it is also true that one should expect diminishing returns for each additional trigger considered.
Taking also into account the complexities associated to data processing and trigger corrections, a balance must be found in which and how many triggers to consider.

The trigger strategy employed in this work extends the strategy used in the previous \ac{CMS} resonant \bbtt{} result [[cite:&higgs_bbtautau_hy]], which used 2016 data only.
In that analysis, each channel was associated with a specific trigger type: \eletau{} (\mutau{}) was selected with a trigger requiring one electron (muon), and \tautau{} used a trigger requiring two tau leptons.
In the following, we detail the new triggers used in the resonant \hhbbtt{} analysis for the first time, and explain in which phase-space regions they are applied.
