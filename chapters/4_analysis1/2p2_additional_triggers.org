Triggers which had not been present in previous analysis' iterations have been added to our analysis.
The aim of the inclusions is to extend the available phase-space, increasing signal acceptance.
The first novelty is the usage of an unprescaled $\metnomu$ trigger.
This variable closely follows [[eq:met]], but reconstructed muons are explicitly removed from its definition:
#+NAME: eq:metnomu
\begin{equation}
\metnomu = - \sum_{i}^{\text{N}_{\text{particles}}}\vec{p}_{\text{T},\,i} \, + \, \sum_{j}^{\text{N}_{\text{muons}}}\vec{p}_{\text{T},\,j} \: .
\end{equation}
\noindent The above quantity is introduced for the computation of $\metnomu$ trigger \acp{SF}, as described in [[#sec:met_trigger_sfs]].
Following the same logic, a similar $\mhtnomu$ quantity can be defined by extending [[eq:mht]], and removing contributions from \ac{PF} muons.
The $\metnomu$ trigger requires the $\metnomu$ and $\mhtnomu$ of the event to lie above \SI{120}{\GeV}.
The new trigger is used in all channels, exploiting the low lepton \ac{pt} kinematic region not covered by legacy triggers.
Since no $|\eta|$ cut is enforced, the $\metnomu$ trigger also enables to reach $\text{high-}|\eta|$ events that would otherwise not be kept by the cross lepton triggers.
Even leptonic triggers without explicit $|\eta|$ cuts are limited by the kinematic range of their corresponding trigger \acp{SF}.
Furthermore, given the additional $\pt$ thresholds one has to apply on top of the \ac{HLT} thresholds, as described in [[#sec:selection]], the $\metnomu$ trigger brings more events than one might initially think.
We also expect the $\metnomu$ trigger to become more and more significant with increasing $\mx$.
For low resonance masses, the two Higgs bosons lie close to a back-to-back topology in the laboratory frame, and the \ac{MET} (and $\metnomu$) largely cancels.
As $\mx$ increases, the bosons become more and more collimated, leading to a \ac{MET} increase.
Taking into account the hard \ac{pt} thresholds of the $\text{di-}\tau$ trigger when compared to legacy triggers in other decay channels, and the fact that the acceptance increase applies to two \tauhs{} rather than one, we expect the \tautau{} channel to benefit the most from the added trigger.
Finally, we have imposed a $\metnomu$ threshold of \SI{150}{\GeV} for all data-taking periods, to take into account the turn-on of the trigger.
This choice is detailed in [[#sec:met_trigger_sfs]], where the corresponding \ac{SF} are derived.

A \stau{} trigger is also added for the first time to our analysis, requesting a hadronic tau lepton \ac{pt} above \SI{180}{\GeV} for 2017 and 2018, and above \SI{140}{\GeV} for 2016.
The trigger covers events with exactly one high-\ac{pt} \tauh{}.
When both leptons have a high \ac{pt}, the legacy triggers are used, since they have a larger efficiency, as discussed in [[#sec:trigger_regions]] and shown in [[fig:compare_gains]].
We note that the $\metnomu$ trigger also extends the acceptance for high-\ac{pt} \tauhs{}, given the $|\eta|<2.1$ of the \stau{} trigger.

The most significant selections included in the newly added $\metnomu$ and \stau{} triggers are listed in [[tab:trigger_met_stau]].
Trigger \acp{SF} are applied to correct for discrepancies between data and \ac{MC} trigger efficiencies.

#+CAPTION: Trigger paths used in the \eletau{}, \mutau{} and \tautau{} channels for the three years of data-taking and corresponding integrated luminosity values. Within each year, the \logicor{} of all the paths is always intended, also including the triggers in the legacy region. The paths requiring one \tauh{} were updated during the 2018 data-taking after the implementation of the \ac{HPS} algorithm. The Isolation (Iso) criteria reported in the table are explained in the text.
