+ Analysis covers non-resonant via ggF and resonant HH and HY
+ CMS non-res result: $-13 (-11) < k_{\lambda} < 18 (16)$ and $\sigma_{HH} < 930 (740) fb$ or $\sigma_{HH} < 33 (26) \sigma_{HH}^{SM}$
+ Results are obtained by performing a fit to $m_{\gamma\gamma}$ in signal-enriched categories
  + the signal and background components of the maximum likelihood fit are analytic functions of $m_{\gamma\gamma}$
  + the background contiuum is modelled from data using the discrete profiling method
  + the signal is modelled from simulation
+ The signal is fitted independently for different categories and data taking years with a double Crystal Ball function
+ The background also includes a $H\rightarrow \gamma\gamma$ contribution which is modelled just like the signal
+ The discrete profiling method considers multiple analytical functions, implementing by construction a systematic for the choice of the analytic function used
  + the method minimizes the likelihood to choose a function for each category, also penalizing functions with many parameters
+ The dominant backgrounds are irreducible prompt $\gamma\gamma$ + jets and reducible $\gamma$ + jets (jets are misidentified as photons or $\tau$ leptons)
  + sub-dominant backgrounds are taken from simulation
+ Multiple selection variables are used, including a mass window cut on the di-photon mass between 100 and 180 GeV
+ The taus are reconstructed in all possible channels
  + a DY veto is applied: reject events compatible with $Z\rightarrow ll$ or $Z\rightarrow ll\gamma$ with a mass window cut around $m_{Z}$
+ BDT is used for non-res, using as input input features related to the events' kinematical properties
  + It is $m_{\gamma\gamma}$-independent at first order, to avoid sculpting scultping the di-photon mass leading to fake excesses
+ Sequential boundaries are applied to the BDT's output to create categories of different signal purity; the splitting maximizes signal sensitivity
