\paragraph{ATLAS}
In preparation for the increased LHC luminosities foreseen for the future, ATLAS will replace the ASICs5 that handle the calorimeter signals by more radiation hard ones. [[cite:&wigmans_new_developments]]

+ =\ac{HGCAL Nose}= very forward portion of the endcap calorimeter covering pseudorapidity values between 3 and 4.2, locate in front of the \ac{HF}, very similar to \ac{HGCAL} \SI{4.6}{\mega\gray} maximum absorbed dose and \SI{2e16}{\nequiv}, both twice as large as \ac{HGCAL}'s values, good for VBS scattering measurement of longitudinally polarized channels (two very forwards jets), also good for VBF production of H and HH

+ =HGCAL= is detailed in the next section
