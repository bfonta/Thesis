List all subdetector upgrades in \ac{CMS}.

\paragraph{Pixels}
+ New Layer 1 at 29mm from the beamline

\paragraph{MTD}
[[cite:&mtd_tdr;&mtd_timing_plot]]

\paragraph{HGCAL Nose}
very forward portion of the endcap calorimeter covering pseudorapidity values between 3 and 4.2, locate in front of the \ac{HF}, very similar to \ac{HGCAL} \SI{4.6}{\mega\gray} maximum absorbed dose and \SI{2e16}{\nequiv}, both twice as large as \ac{HGCAL}'s values, good for VBS scattering measurement of longitudinally polarized channels (two very forwards jets), also good for VBF production of H and HH

\paragraph{HGCAL}
A detailed description is provided in [[ref:sec:hgcal_intro]].

\paragraph{HCAL}
+ in HCAL hybrid photodiodes were replaces by SiPMs (in Run1)
+ HCAL brings new depth and timing information

\paragraph{Muons}

\paragraph{GEM}
After the introduction of GE1/1 superchambers in \run{3}, two additional GEM detector types will be installed before the start of the \ac{HL-LHC}. The first, named GE2/1, consists on superchambers similar to the already installed GE1/1 superchambers, but larger, covering \num{20} degrees in \ac{phi}. The \ac{eta} coverage will also be slightly extended, from \num{2.15} to \num{2.4}. The second type, called \ac{ME0}, refers to superchambers located closer to the beamline, at $2.0 < |\eta| < 2.8$, which also span \num{20} degrees in \ac{phi} [[cite:&gem_trigger_data_format;&gem_tdr]].
It will be installed on the back of \ac{HGCAL}.

\paragraph{L1}
+ Folded event building in Run3
+ GPUs in Run3 (and replace CUDA by Alpaka)
+ using PNet in HLT
+ special paths for LLPs
+ scouting

\paragraph{BRIL}
+ lumi measurements are challenging
+ uncertainty of 1.4% in 2022

\paragraph{...}
