The \ac{HL-LHC} will start taking data in 2029, achieving unprecedented instantaneous luminosities of \SI{\sim5e34}{\per\cm\squared\per\second} (more than twice of \ac{LHC}â€™s current value) and a \ac{PU} of up to 200 (currently \num{\sim 50} on average [[cite:&pileup_twiki]]).
An integrated luminosity of \SI{\sim 3}{\per\atto\barn} should be reached over a period of 10 years [[cite:&hllhc]], while current CMS endcap calorimeters are designed to sustain up to \SI{500}{\per\femto\barn}.

A dramatic performance degradation is foreseeable for higher luminosities.
