A more powerful \ac{LHC} will increase the accurancy of current measurements and enhance the sensitivity to rare processes through both direct and indirect searches which occur below the current sensitivity level, and with more challenging signatures.
The \ac{HL-LHC} is expected to provide high-precision measurements of the \ac{SM}, particular in Higgs physics: the Higgs boson (H) self-coupling, via direct and indirect measurements (see [[ref:sec:dihiggs]]), higgs couplings, flavour physics, BSM

A virtuous cycle often takes place between data collection and improvements in simulation and theory calculations.
In the following we provide a brief and necessarily incomplete overview of some of the physics motivations to build the \ac{HL-LHC}.
A detailed description is out of the scope of this work.


\paragraph{EW processes}

The increase in luminosity provided by the \ac{HL-LHC} will provide a significant boost in sensitivity to measurements of (small) electroweak couplings, especially when dealing with low cross-section processes.
This notably applies to W mass $\mw$ and weak mixing angle $\thw$ measurements, but also to \ac{VBF}, \ac{VBS}, and tri-boson production measurements.
\num{\sim 2e6} W boson events will be collected per week, leading to a statistical sensitivity of about \SI{10}{\MeV} for the $W$ mass, and significantly lower for cross-section measurements.
The added luminosity might also help solving the tension between old $\theta_{W}$ measurements performed by \ac{LEP} and Tevatron, adding to the recent \ac{CMS} result [[cite:&weak_mixing_angle_cms]], which agree with the \ac{SM}, just as previous \ac{LHC}-hosted measurements.
Concerning \ac{VBF} and \ac{VBS} processes, despite the overall lower cross-section, of about one order of magnitude with respect to the \ac{ggF} production, the presence of additional hard and forward jets enables a very significant reduction of the multijet background.
This is particularly true for large rapidity separations $\Delta \dijetrap \gtrsim 4.5$ and di-jet invariant masses
$\dijetmass \gtrsim \SI{700}{\GeV}$, where \ac{VBF} production dominates over \ac{ggF}.
In \ac{VBS}, measurements of longitudinal scattering of two $V$ ($V=W,Z$) is particularly enticing, as it is still unknown whether the Higgs alone can avoid a divergent behaviour of the scattering amplitude at high energies, violating unitarity [[cite:&vbs2]].
The longitudinal component of the $V$ bosons is in particular tightly connected to the Higgs mechanism and \ac{EWSB}, since massless particles only have transversal components.
However, differential measurements of gauge boson polarization is harder given the reduced cross-section of the longitudinal-only components.
Would unitarity be violated, particle probability would no longer be conserved: the calculated number of $V$ pairs produced in the interaction would exceed the incident flux [[cite:&thomson]].
There is also the possibility for the longitudinal components of the $V$ bosons to be strongly coupled at \SI{\sim 1}{\TeV} center-of-mass energies [[cite:&vbs1]], allowing for instance the formation of resonance states in technicolor models.
\ac{VBS} also forms the ideal field for anomalous gauge couplings measurements, especially quartic couplings.
Finally, even rarer tri-boson processes (\sigma\SI{\sim 0.1}{\pico\barn}) brings an extra handle on \ac{SM} testing.

\paragraph{Strong interactions}

The \ac{HL-LHC} will enable an increase in the kinematic reach for jet and photon production.
This will in turn reduce the associated experimental uncertainties, improving \ac{PDF} modeling.
High-$\pt$ b-jets are sensitive to higher-order corrections, parton shower modeling and \acp{PDF}.
Therefore, investigating the b-jet contribution to the total jet cross section enables to test the available theoretical predictions.
The shape of the distributions of jets of various flavours will also be known with a higher precision, especially in the tails.
On the photon side, diphotons with high invariant mass are ideal probes to test the \ac{SM} and search for \ac{BSM}. In particular, prompt photons do not interact with other final state particles, enabling a precise study of \ac{QCD} [[cite:&diphoton_cdf]].
The \ac{HL-LHC} will enable a more precise knowledge of photon related cross-sections.
For the first time, the \ac{HL-LHC} will make possible the measurement of quantum correlations between partons in the proton by precisely studying differential distributions.
This brings an improvement in \ac{DPS} modeling, which has been so far very limited.
\ac{DPS} can be as relevant as the single proton scattering for same-sign $WW$ final states involving $b\bar{b}$ or $c\bar{c}$ quark pairs.

\paragraph{Top physics}
The heaviest particle in the \ac{SM} plays an important role in \ac{EWSB} and in \ac{BSM} searches.
With the \ac{HL-LHC} we will be able to improve the precision of the $\mt$ measurement, and to study $t\bar{t}$ differential distributions in more detail, reaching $\mtt\sim 7\,\si{\TeV}$ and $\pt\sim 2.5\,\si{\TeV}$.
This will provide benefits for \ac{PDF} measurements.
One can also explore \ac{BSM} for $\mtt > 7\,\si{\TeV}$ due to the low \ac{SM} background.
An interesting link might be drawn between the results of \ac{LHCb} and \ac{ATLAS}/\ac{CMS}, given the increase in $\eta$ reach up to \num{\sim 4}.
There will be as well the possibility to observe the rare $t\bar{t}t\bar{t}$ production for the first time, despite its small cross-section of $\mathcal{O}(10)\,\si{\per\femto\barn}$.
$t\bar{t}t\bar{t}$ can be used to constrain some of the Wilson coefficients associated to \ac{EFT} dimension-6 operators, to further study the top Yukawa coupling constrain, including its magnitude and \ac{CP} properties, since it can occur via de mediation fo a Higgs boson [[cite:&tttt]], and even to assess the presence of the non-\ac{SM} top quark dipole moment.

\paragraph{Forward physics}

Assuming concepts similar to the current \ac{CTPPS} [[cite:&ctpps_tdr]] and the \ac{AFP} [[cite:&afp_tdr]] are extended in the \ac{HL-LHC} phase, \ac{CEP} $pp \rightarrow p\,(\gamma\gamma\rightarrow \text{X})\,p$ phenomena, among which light-by-light scattering ($\text{X} = \gamma\gamma$), will be further explored \ac{CEP}.
Other processes include, for instance, $\text{X} = \mu\mu,\,\tau\tau,\,Z,\,H,\,WW,\,ZZ$, and enable the study of anomalous gauge couplings and the magnetic moment of the $\tau$, among other studies [[cite:&ctpps_varela;&ctpps_pitt]].
\ac{CEP} processes carry particular interest since they bring production of charged particles initiated only by photons, into what amounts to using the \ac{LHC} as a $\gamma\gamma$ collider.
In parallel, a whole plethora of \ac{QCD}-related measurements can be performed in \acp{CEP}.
The \ac{HL-LHC} will push \ac{CEP} processes to higher masses and lower cross-sections, increasing their discovery potential.


\paragraph{Higgs boson pairs}

ref:fig:hh_nonres_projections allows the comparison of early HH \run{2} results with current full \run{2} upper cross-section limits.
An improvement of a factor of \num{\sim 7} was obtained, much above what a naive luminosity scaling would provide, given the four-fold increase in collected data.
The improvement over the luminosity baseline is due to multiple areas, such as trigger, identification, and reconstruction algorithms, but also to the increase of explored finals state channels, made possible by the gradual increase in available number of events.

\num{150} million Higgs bosons and \num{120} thousand Higgs boson pairs are expected to be produced during the \ac{HL-LHC} phase.
This will enable the most precise measurement of the triple and quartic Higgs couplings ever, with the possibility of observing the former for the first time, most likely after combining \ac{CMS} and \ac{ATLAS} datasets.
The precision of \ac{EFT} couplings will also benefit from the increased number of events.
The sensitivity will in general take advantage from the extension of the phase-space, which adds relevance to yet unexplored HH production modes and decay channels, to be added to future multi-channel combinations [[cite:&higgs_10_years]].
At present, none of the analyses used to search for the production of Higgs boson pairs is statistically limited [[cite:&andre_david_higgs_ten_years]].
However, \ac{ggF} theory uncertainties might soon become important.

A series of new techniques should improve results even further, starting from \run{3} and extending into the \ac{HL-LHC}, including new machine learning techniques or better estimates of \ac{QCD} multi-jet background.
The usage of \ac{PNet} [[cite:&particle_net]] for \tau-initiated jets and the application of transformer technology to jet tagging [[cite:&particle_transformer]] are expected to boost HH sensitivity.
Additionally, an improved trigger strategy has been implemented, considering both data scouting and parking cite:&parking_scouting_run3_cms, and including \ac{PNet} b-tagging and \tau-tagging at trigger level.
We also expect that some HH analysis might benefit from the inclusion of synthetic datasets [[cite:&zz_zh_bbbb]].
As discussed in ref:sec:indirect_searches, indirect searches can very significantly contribute to an increase in $\lh{3}$ sensitivity.
In conclusion, the next decade looks extremely promising in what concerns HH coupling measurements.
Such measurements would deeply impact a whole range of available theoretical frameworks, such has flavour models (with \acp{2HDM} as an example) and models implying a \ac{EWPT} (see Section ref:sec:ewpt).
If we also take a positive and historical stand, considering how \ac{LHC} experiments have consistently surpassed initial estimates, we can surely hope to be soon able to assess the way the Higgs particle interacts with itself.
