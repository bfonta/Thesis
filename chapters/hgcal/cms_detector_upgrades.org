The extreme radiation levels and high \acp{PU} mandate an extensive upgrade of most \ac{LHC} detector systems, and \ac{CMS} is no exception.
For the scope of this thesis, the drastic upgrades put forward in the trigger system and endcap calorimeters take precedence, and will be described in [[ref:sec:phase2_trigger_system,sec:hgcal_intro]], respectively.
However, given the intricacies of the online and offline trigger chain, and the ideas behind \ac{PF} reconstruction, considering subdetectors as independent elements is naive and ultimately wrong.
We therefore think a brief summary of all other subdetector upgrades is worthwhile, and can help put in perspective all recent and substantial efforts of the \ac{CMS} Collaboration [[cite:&cms_run3_developments]].

\myparagraph{Tracker}

\noindent The pixel and strip tracking detectors are subject to the highest radiations and doses among all \ac{CMS} components, and their performance will abruptly degrade after \SI{500}{\invfb}.
The radiation levels are expected to increase by one order of magnitude during the \ac{HL-LHC}.
The pixel detector originally installed has already been replaced during the technical stop between the 2016 and 2017 data-taking periods [[cite:&pixel_phase1_upgrade2;&pixel_phase1_upgrade1]].
It structure its designed with accessibility in mind, such that an update of the pixels does not imply moving the strips.
The channel occupancy is required to stay within 0.1% for the pixels and 1% for the strips, which is quite demanding at \num{200} \ac{PU}.
The track separation is also expected to be improved relative to the one currently observed for high-energy jets, where hits are merged at the level of the pixels.
Following the recent upgrade, the material budget of the tracker should also be decreased, since it negatively affects the donwstream calorimeters and overall \ac{PF} reconstruction.
The tracker will also be integrated in the \ac{L1} trigger chain for the first time, enabling the reconstruction of trigger tracks up to $|\eta|=2.4$ in a \ac{PF}-like approach (see [[#sec:phase2_trigger_system]]), and requiring updated reconstruction algorithms, to avoid losing selection efficiency.

The tracker will thus be entirely replaced, with considerably increased granularity and \ac{eta} coverage extended up to $|\eta| \sim 4.0$, both for the pixels and strips [[cite:&cms_tracker_phase2_tdr]].
The number of layers will be kept unchanged, ensuring particles traverse on average at least \num{6} layers, even for the highest \ac{eta} values.
The updates will bring better resolutions and lower fake rates.

+ *Inner Tracker*: Planar pixel modules will still be present, but will be significantly thinner and lighter: \num{100}- to \SI{150}{\micro\meter}-thick sensors compared to the current \SI{300}{\micro\meter} ones, developed in partnership with \ac{ATLAS} [[cite:&rd53]].
  The increase in granularity, which comes with a reduction in area by a factor of \num{6}, improves the impact parameter resolution and  limits the occupancy.
  The pixels are organized in $336\times432$ arrays in a dedicated radiation-hard chip, which is designed to also mitigate \acp{SEE} [[cite:&inner_tracker_phase2]].
  The flexible design of the \ac{IT} will continue to allow replacements during technical stops.
  
+ *Outer Tracker*: For the \ac{OT}, the update is mainly driven by the requirement to introduce the information from the tracker at \ac{L1}.
  The strips will be grouped into over \num{13000} modules with two different configurations: /2-strip/ and /pixel-strip/.
  The former is limited inasmuch it lacks segmentation in the $z$ direction [[cite:&abbaneo]], and is therefore included in the outer \ac{OT} layers only.
  For the three inner layers, /pixel-strips/ are used, where each module has \num{\sim 1000} strips and \num{\sim 30000} pixels.
  The barrel pixel-strips measure a third spatial coordinate, constraining the $z$ coordinate of the primary vertex to a \SI{1}{\mm} region, helping in vertex discrimination.
  Contrary to the current tracker, the future barrel \ac{OT} will have its first three layers tilted, perpendicularly oriented relative to the \ac{IP}.
  This mechanically challenging layout is meant to recover from inefficiencies arising due to particles traversing near-adjacent double-sided modules, in consecutive layers, which cannot communicate with eachother (see [[fig:tracker_update]], and compare it with [[fig:tracker]]).

\myparagraph{MTD}

\noindent The \ac{MTD} [[cite:&mtd_tdr;&mtd_timing_plot]] has no analog in the current \phase{1} \ac{CMS} detector.
Its addition is driven by the \num{4}-fold \ac{PU} increase brought by the \ac{HL-LHC}.
Indeed, the primary vertex has to be disentangled from all \ac{PU} vertices, and timing measurements have been shown to provide the required extra handle, as expected from adding a new uncorrelated dimension to the analysis.
The \ac{MTD} will have the ability to measure the production time of \acp{MIP} for vertex location at a \SI{30}{\pico\second} level, although a deterioration of a factor of \num{2} is expected by the end of the \ac{HL-LHC}.
This is to be compared with the average \SI{\sim 200}{\pico\second} root mean square of individual interactions in a \ac{BX}.
The sinergy between the tracker and the \ac{MTD} will enable the association of tracks to the right vertices more often, even for scenarios with closely packed vertices, helping in \ac{LLP} reconstruction, charged hadron identification and b-jet identification.
The latter is tightly connected with the di-Higgs measurement performed in this thesis, as detailed in [[#sec::bbtautau_intro]], where precision timing can bring an additional \SI{\sim 20}{\percent} signal yield.
Another interesting cooperation strategy can be envisaged with the calorimeters, especially \ac{HGCAL} (introduced in [[#sec:hgcal_intro]]), which will also provide timing measurements with a similar precision, and can thus be used to ensure compatibility with \ac{MTD} measurements.
Other benefits are forseen, like better measurements of $\tau$ lepton decays due to the improved \ac{MET} reconstruction quality, or improved \ac{VBF} tagging.

The \ac{MTD} will be located in the gap between the tracker and the calorimeters, in both the barrel as the \ac{BTL}, and in endcap regions, as the \acp{ETL}, having a \SI{28}{\meter\squared} surface area.
In the \ac{BTL}, crystal bars read out by a pair of \acp{SiPM} have a granularity implying a 7% occupation per crystal at \num{200} \ac{PU}.
The low occupation limits the probability of double hits during a \ac{BX}.
Bars are grouped in modules, which are organized in \acp{RU}, which in turn are structured in trays, supported by the tracker support tube (see [[fig:mtdbarrel]]).
In the \acp{ETL}, located at a distance of \SI{3}{\meter} from the \ac{IP}, a two-disk structure of \ac{Si} sensors will achieve the desired time resolution with two hits per track.
The \ac{Si} technology was chosen due to the higher radiation at the endcaps.
The same radiation also requires the addition of a neutron moderator, which shields the tracker from back-scattered particles.
The \ac{MTD} will consist on more than \num{300000} \acp{SiPM}, which will cover an $\eta<3$ area on both sides.
It will remain accessible to allow for repairs or future updates, again related to the high radiation levels.
All in all, the \ac{MTD} will help \ac{CMS} maintaining its current performances in a harsher environment.

\myparagraph{Muon detectors}

+ *Muons*: be complemented by installing state-of-the-art Resistive Plate Chamber (RPC) detectors and the newly developed Gas Electron Multiplier (GEM) chambers. These additions to the muon
detection system will increase the geometrical coverage to $|\eta| \leq 2.8$, ensuring the possibility of
extended muon track matching in the forward region. With the aim of further increasing the

+ *GEM*: After the introduction of GE1/1 superchambers in \run{3}, two additional GEM detector types will be installed before the start of the \ac{HL-LHC}. The first, named GE2/1, consists on superchambers similar to the already installed GE1/1 superchambers, but larger, covering \num{20} degrees in \ac{phi}. The \ac{eta} coverage will also be slightly extended, from \num{2.15} to \num{2.4}. The second type, called \ac{ME0}, refers to superchambers located closer to the beamline, at $2.0 < |\eta| < 2.8$, which also span \num{20} degrees in \ac{phi} [[cite:&gem_trigger_data_format;&gem_tdr]]. It will be installed on the back of \ac{HGCAL}.
