Any conclusions to be drawn from this study naturally depend on the thresholds imposed on $\rint$ and $\widthratio$.
In the following, we choose as thresholds $\rint=\pm10$ and $\pm20\%$, and $\widthratio=5$, \num{10} and \SI{20}{\percent}.
The $\widthratio$ values are defined taking into account jet resolutions achieved by \ac{CMS}, which amount typically to 15 to 20% at \SI{30}{\GeV}, 10% at \SI{100}{\GeV}, and 5% at \SI{1}{\TeV} [[cite:&jet_resolution_run2]].
The contours corresponding to the thresholds above and the exclusion limits derived from the HH combination in the singlet model are shown in [[fig:interf_maps]].
The red HH exclusion region uses the total cross section histograms as shown in [[fig:maps_2d]].
The HH combination technically did not use the real singlet model, but rather the Randall-Sundrum, \ac{NWA} \spin{0} model, usually considered for \spin{0} resonance searches [[cite:&xanda_benchmarks_wed]].
Given that the two models have the same scalar coupling structure, interpretations in the context of the singlet model remain valid.
The $\widthratio$ curves are obtained using [[eq:width]], and $\rint$ curves use 2D histograms similar to the total cross section ones, after considering [[eq:rint]].
Positive and negative interference ratio contours are shown in green ($\rint=+10\%, +20\%$) and blue ($\rint=-10\%, -20\%$).
The contours are found to swap positions at $\mx = 400\,\si{\GeV}$, likely because of the peak of the nonresonant HH distribution.
For a given $\mx$, the quadratic dependence of $\gx$ on both $\sina$ and $\lhhx$ according to [[eq:width]] leads to the dotted black elliptical isolines of constant $\widthratio$.
Those lines denote thresholds beyond which $\Gamma_{\text{X}}/\mx$ exceeds 5%, 10% or 20%, implying that the \ac{NWA} might no longer be accurate.
The experimental bound from the HH combination discussed in [[#sec:combinations]] is obtained from the 95% \ac{CL} upper limit on $\sigma(\text{pp}\,{\rightarrow}\,\text{X})\mathcal{B}(\text{X}\,{\rightarrow}\,\text{HH})$, with the X production cross section growing with increasing $\sina$, and $\mathcal{B}(\text{X}\,{\rightarrow}\,\text{HH})$ growing with increasing $\lhhx$.
We note that large values of $\sina$, corresponding to regions where the H boson is less \ac{SM}-like, also tend to be excluded by precision measurements of the Higgs boson, usually at \num{\sim 0.16} and above [[cite:&papa1]].
For most of the studied mass points, sizable interference ratios occur only in parameter regions to which the current measurements are not yet sensitive, or at too large values of $\sina$.
In particular, for large resonance masses, with $\mx$ above \SI{600}{\GeV}, where interference effects tend to grow, measurements are far below the current sensitivity and might only play a role when the full data set from the HL-LHC becomes available [[cite:&HLHELHC]]. 
However, there are regions at intermediate $\mx$ where the interpretation of \ac{NWA}-based limits for HH derived in the singlet model would solicit some care already in the \run{2} combination (for example $\mx = 500\,\si{\GeV}$, $\sina = 0.2$ and $\lhhx = 400\,\si{\GeV}$).
It is important to note that such interpretations are generally model dependent.

The differential cross sections as a function of $\mhh$ are shown for a subset of points from the ($\sin\alpha$, $\lhhx$) parameter space in [[fig:interf_lineshapes_280]] for $\mx=280\,\si{\GeV}$, and in [[fig:interf_lineshapes_500]] for $\mx=500\,\si{\GeV}$. 
The parameters are chosen such that $\widthratio = 5\%$, which is well below the detector resolution, and $\rint=\pm10\%$ or $\pm20\%$ so that sizable interference effects are expected. 
The lineshapes show points in parameter space where the $\rint$ contours intersect with lines of constant $\widthratio = 5\%$ in [[fig:interf_maps]]. 
The mass points of $\mx=280\,\si{\GeV}$ and $500\,\si{\GeV}$ have been chosen because these values are on the left- and right-hand side of the peak in the $\mhh$ distribution for nonresonant \ac{SM} HH production. 
The signature indicating the presence of the X resonance, including interference effects, can be assessed as the difference between $\sigma^{\text{full}}$ (red graph) and $\sigma^{\text{nonresonant}}$ (green graph).
In the $\mx=280\,\si{\GeV}$ case, the resonance peak is at a mass where the nonresonant background is low in comparison.
The shape of central part of the peak is thus not much affected, and a classical bump hunt should still work.
Still, the signature develops a peak-dip structure for a negative interference ratio, and a shoulder-like enhancement towards large masses for a positive interference ratio.
For a precision measurement, which is not yet in our reach, a distortion of the signal shape would have to be taken into account.
For $\mx=500\,\si{\GeV}$, in the top panels of [[fig:interf_lineshapes_500]], the signal shape is found to be strongly modified by the interference effect.
Similar distortion effects as seen for $\mx=280\,\si{\GeV}$, albeit on reversed sides of the peak, are visible for $\mx=500\,\si{\GeV}$. 
The distortion however occurs in a ($\sin\alpha$, $\lhhx$) parameter region still relatively far from the regions currently probed, as can be appreciated in [[fig:interf_maps]].
The total cross section, for all $\mx$ values, is modified as specified by $\rint$.
Although the expected interference effects clearly depend on the underlying model, they can be expected to be of mounting importance in the future as the \ac{LHC} data set increases.

Recent projections for HH results [[cite:&interf_studies]] also enable to study the level at which the parameters of the singlet model might be excluded in the future, namely at the end of the \ac{HL-LHC}.
Using $\kl = 1$, limits are derived in the ($\sina$, $\lhhx$) plane from the combination of resonant HH searches. 
Resonances between \num{280} and \SI{1000}{\GeV} are probed using \run{2} data and are projected to integrated luminosities corresponding to \num{300}, \num{1000}, and \SI{3000}{\invfb}.
Projected exclusion regions at \SI{95}{\percent} \ac{CL} are shown in [[fig:interf_prospects]], for four different luminosity values, following systematics scenarios mentioned in [[#sec:prospects]] ("S1" and "S2").
The \ac{HL-LHC} dataset of \SI{3000}{\invfb} has the potential to considerably expand the present exclusion regions in the ($\sina$, $\lhhx$) plane for all values of $\mx$. 
Compared to the present limits, the largest improvement is observed for large masses, $\mx=600\,\si{\GeV}$ and higher, where large regions of the ($\sina$, $\lhhx$) plane can be probed, and part of the plane even up to $\mx = 1\,\si{\TeV}$.

The expected limits from the \run{2} dataset have been projected to integrated luminosities of \num{300}, \num{1000}, and \SI{3000}{\invfb}. Excluded areas are indicated by the direction of the hatching along the exclusion contours. Published in [[cite:&interf_studies]].

We finalize this Chapter by noting that all conclusions drawn above are model dependent, and may well be different for other \ac{BSM} scenarios.
This means that distortions could be stronger and affected parameter regions could be larger.
We also recall that a (reasonable) choice of parameter thresholds had to be made, and which could have been different.
This represents however the first dedicated interference study within \ac{CMS}, hinting already at the necessity of avoiding the \ac{NWA} in future HH analyses.
