The majority of studies involving the \ac{SM} Higgs boson or \ac{BSM} particles considers the Narrow Width Approximation, where the production via mode $i$ and decay $f$ of a particle P can be factorized as:
#+NAME: eq:nwa_factorisation
\begin{equation}
(\sigma \cdot \mathcal{B})(i \rightarrow \text{P} \rightarrow f) = \frac{\sigma_{i} \cdot \Gamma_{f}}{\Gamma_{\text{P}}} \:\: ,
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\sigma_{i}$ is the cross section of the production mode $i$, $\mathcal{B}$ is the \ac{BR} defined as $\Gamma_{f}/\Gamma_{\text{P}}$, $\Gamma_{f}$ is the partial decay width into the final state $f$, and $\Gamma_{\text{P}}$ is the total width of particle P.
The approximation most notably holds when the width $\Gamma$ of a particle is much smaller than its mass $\text{M}$, $\Gamma \ll \text{M}$, hence its name.
Additionally, four other conditions are required to justify the \ac{NWA} applicability [[cite:&nwa_breakdown]]: /i)/ the mass of the daughter particles is much smaller than the mass of the resonance, /ii)/ the center-of-mass-energy is much larger than the mass of the resonance, /iii)/ at the diagram level, the propagator of the resonance must be separable from the corresponding matrix element, and /iv)/ no significant /interferences/ with nonresonant processes exist.
The validity of all four points strongly depend on the process being probed.
The last point is particularly relevant in the work here described, and is later shown not to be applicable in the full probed phase-space.

Experimentally speaking, the \ac{NWA} equates to setting the particle's width $\Gamma$ to zero or to an arbitrarily small value, much smaller than the particle's mass and smaller than the detector's resolution.
For \ac{SM} Higgs boson analyses, this is usually motivated by simplicity, also taking into account that the predicted \ac{SM} $\gh$ of \SI{\sim 4.1}{\MeV} [[cite:&YellowReport4 App.A]] at $\mh=125.08 \pm 0.12\,\si{\GeV}$[fn:: The value of the PDG average [[cite:&PDG]] at the time of writing is slightly different, and based on older \ac{CMS} and \ac{ATLAS} measurements: [[cite:&higgs_mass_cms;&higgs_mass_atlas;&higgs_mass_atlas_cms]]] [[cite:&higgs_mass_cms_run2]], compatible with measurements [[cite:&higgs_width_cms;&higgs_width_atlas]], is around two orders of magnitude smaller than what the \ac{CMS} detector resolution can currently provide [[cite:&higgs_mass_cms_run2;&higgs_mass_cms]].
However, when considering resonant processes with two Higgs bosons, one cannot /a priori/ argue that the detector resolution will always be lower than the width of any \ac{BSM} resonance \xhh{}.
Instead, and especially for large resonance masses, $\gx$ values are expected to be large, potentially invalidating the \ac{NWA}.
Despite the above, the \ac{NWA} has been repeatedly used in past \ac{CMS} HH resonant analyses, including the analysis presented in this Thesis.
A sizable signal width can create interferences between the resonant and nonresonant components of the signal, which are absent under the \ac{NWA}.
The interference could be either destructive or constructive, respectively reducing or enhancing the HH production rate [[cite:&CarenaWidthEnhancement]].
The change can be significant, both overall and as a function of $\mhh$, altering the di-Higgs /lineshapes/.
Some examples are shown in [[ref:fig:interf_lineshapes_280,fig:interf_lineshapes_500]].

I have been the main responsible for a \ac{CMS} phenomenological study that assesses the impact of the \ac{NWA} in different phase-space regions of the inclusive \ac{ggF} \xhh{} process, and am the sole author of all \ac{CMS} results presented in this Chapter.
To the best of my knowledge, this is the first time such a complete study on the validity of the \ac{NWA} is performed within the \ac{CMS} Collaboration.
The study was originally motivated by my involvement in the \run{2} \hhbbtt{} analysis, the latter representing an ideal setup to test new HH models.
In the end, the work done settled on a more general approach, not specific to any particular decay channel.
The ongoing \run{3} should see the first appearances of non-\ac{NWA} results, since large deviations with respect to the \ac{NWA} approach have recently drawn a significant interest from the community.
For simplicity, we here consider the resonant model with the smallest number of additional free parameters: the singlet model [[cite:&papa1]].
Similar studies could be repeated with other, more complex models, such as models containing two singlets [[cite:&papa3]].
As a future step, we would like to extend the same study to the \bbtt{} channel, namely measuring the impact of the \ac{NWA} on the final upper limits of the analysis.
The content of this Chapter was published as part of a review paper covering the Higgs boson production searches through decays of heavy resonances [[cite:&interf_studies]].
