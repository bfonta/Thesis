This Chapter covers the latest iteration of the resonant \xhhbbtt{} analysis performed at \ac{CMS}, based on the complete \run{2} data.
The analysis was initially based on the previous nonresonant \bbtt{} analysis [[cite:&higgs_bbtautau_nonres]], and has been diverging ever since, reflecting changes arising due to dataset updates, and also to several improvements: /i/) trigger strategy update, /ii/) selection (modest) update, /iii/) optimization of the boosted category, /iv/) retraining of the \hhbtag{} algorithm, /v/) replacement of the $m_{\tau\tau}$ regression algorithm, /vi/) replacement of the final discriminant, /vii/) various updates of systematic uncertainties.
A large fraction of the work was devoted to fixing various bugs, which will not be addressed for the sake of interest and brevity.

* Disclaimer
The content reported in this chapter and the next are the result of the work of an analysis team.
It corresponds to one additional analysis iteration for \hhbbtt{} processes, built upon work performed for both resonant and nonresonant types of the same analyses done with older \ac{CMS} datasets.
I do not claim to be the sole author of all the sections that follow.
Instead, I was one of the main analyzers, having contributed in the following topics:
+ Trigger strategy: adding $\metnomu$ and \stau{} triggers, derive their \acp{SF}, define trigger regions, remove event overlap; correct older implementations of the legacy triggers ([[#sec:triggers]])
+ Selection: extend kinematic selection of multiple objects to exploit the new trigger above, update some lepton selections and veto, compute efficiencies
+ Taus: apply new $\tau$ identification \acp{SF}
+ Background: estimation of $\ttbar{}$ \acp{SF} (not currently needed)
+ Systematic uncertainties: implement electron, tau and jet energy corrections/resolutions, and propagate them to \ac{MET}
+ Technical: code rewrite and optimization, job processing, visualization, limit extraction, documentation
  
* Motivation

The exploration of \xhh{} is primarily motivated by the many theoretical models in place that predict the existence of an additional scalar decaying to two Higgs bosons, as covered in [[#sec:res_BSM_hh]]: \acp{WED}, \acp{2HDM}, \ac{SUYS}, ...
It also benefits from sharing a common set of approaches with the nonresonant HH analysis, so much so that on occasion the resonant and nonresonant results are joinly published.

#+CAPTION: \ac{CMS} event display for a \hhbbtt{} event in 2016. Three views are shown (refer to [[#sec:coordinate_system]]), namely $R$ vs $z$ (left) and 3D in cartesian coordinates (right). Red and blue represent, respectively, \ac{ECAL} and \ac{HCAL} energy deposits, where the magnitude is proxied by the dimension of each bar. Tracks are represented in green. The event passed the \rescat{2} selection. The selection of the analysis categories is defined in [[ref:sec:categorization]].

The specific choice of the \bbtt{} decay channel was already justified in [[#sec:final_states]], and comes the balance between background contamination and \ac{BR} size.
In the end, it has consistently been observed as one of the top performant HH channels, together with \bbgg{} and \bbbb{}.
A \ac{SM} \hhbbtt{} event display is shown in [[fig:event_display_res2b_2016]].
Its topology consists on the presence of two jets initiated by a b quark and two tau leptons, all compatible with a trajectory coming from the collision's \ac{PV}.
The b-jets must be discriminated against other types of particles, mostly jets, using techniques discussed in [[#sec:physics_objects]].
The tau leptons are unstable, and decay to lighter particles in \SI{2.9E-13}{\second} [[cite:&PDG]], via leptonic or hadronic decays, as illustrated in [[fig:tau_decay_modes]].
Leptonic decays include either an electron or a muon, plus \ac{MET} in the form of neutrinos.
Hadronic decays are more complex, featuring ...........


It is worth noticing that the \mumu{} channel, despite not being used to extract the final results, is very much useful as a \ac{CR} for \ac{DY} and $\ttbar$ backgrounds, and is used to extract the \acp{SF} for the \ac{MET} trigger presented in [[#sec:met_trigger_sfs]].

#+NAME: fig:tau_decay_modes
#+CAPTION: Illustration of the nine combinations two tau leptons can decay into (left), with corresponding letponic and hadronic feynamn diagrams (right). Six decays are considered in the \xhhbbtt{} analysis, highlighted in orange and corresponding to 88% of the total \ac{BR}. The gray box shows the decays that were not considered in the limits, due to very large backgrounds, which make them much less sensitive than the remaining channels. The \mumu{} channel is however used to derive trigger \acp{SF} and to define a background control region. All decay channels include at least one neutrino, and thus \ac{MET}.

Finally, a recent result [[cite:&atlas_bbtt_res]] of the \ac{ATLAS} Collaboration on the \xhhbbtt{} process observed a small excess at $\mx\sim 1\,\si{\TeV}$ with a local (global) significance of \SI{3.1}{\sigma} (\SI{2.0}{\sigma}).
The analysis thus aims at assessing whether the excess can be replicated by a different experiment, or if it instead corresponds to (yet another) statistical fluctuation.
It is thus fundamental to obtain a sensitivity at least as good as the one from the \ac{ATLAS} result, especially close to the $\mx$ region where the tension was observed.
