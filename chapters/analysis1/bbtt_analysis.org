+ justify bbtt channel choice and explain the different etau, mutau and tautau channels

#+NAME: fig:tau_decay_modes
#+CAPTION: Illustration of the six combinations of the decay modes of two tau leptons. The thick black region corresponds to the channels considered in the analysis and included in the final limits. The dashed square indicates that the \mumu{} channel is not used to extract the limits, but is considered both for defining a \ac{DY}-enriched \ac{CR} and for deriving the $\metnomu$ trigger \acp{SF}. The remaining decay channels amount to only \SI{\sim 9}{\percent} of the $\tau\tau$ branching ratio, being dominated by \ac{DY} and/or $\ttbar$, and therefore do not contribute significantly to the final sensitivity.

#+NAME: fig:event_display_res2b_2016
#+CAPTION: \ac{CMS} event display for a \hhbbtt{} event in 2016. Three views are shown, namely $R$ vs $z$ (top left), $R$ vs $\phi$ (top right), and 3D in cartesian coordinates (bottom). Red and blue represent, respectively, \ac{ECAL} and \ac{HCAL} energy deposits, where the magnitude is proxied the dimension of each bar. Tracks are represented in green. The event passed the \rescat{2} selection. The selection of the analysis categories is defined in [[ref:sec:categorization]].
