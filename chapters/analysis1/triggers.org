The offline data events are recored with a set of \ac{L1}+\ac{HLT} triggers directly related to the analysis decay channels.
Whenever multiple triggers are used for the same channel, a \logicor{} is applied to all trigger paths.
The trigger strategy employed in this work extends the one used in the previous \ac{CMS} resonant \bbtt{} result using only 2016 data [[cite:&higgs_bbtautau_hy]].
There, each channel was associated with a specific trigger type: \eletau{} (\mutau{}) was selected with a trigger requiring on electron (muon), and \tautau{} used a trigger requiring two tau leptons.
