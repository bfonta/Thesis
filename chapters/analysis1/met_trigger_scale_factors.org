\paragraph{MET trigger inefficiency in 2017}

We can see that in 2017 the trigger does not becomes fully efficient for high $\metnomu$ values.
This is because the ~HLT_PFMETNoMu120_PFMHTNoMu120_IDTight~ trigger was not active in the last runs of 2017.
To recover the missing luminosity, we decided to consider instead, for 2017 only, the \logicor{} between ~HLT_PFMETNoMu120_PFMHTNoMu120_IDTight~ and ~HLT_PFMETNoMu120_PFMHTNoMu120_IDTight_PFHT6F~.
We can see in ref:fig:lumi_vs_runnumber_2017 that the new trigger collects more data during the last few runs in 2017.
Indeed, looking at the recomputed efficiency and SF plot in ref:fig:eff_mumu_2017, considering the two triggers taken together, we can observe a full recovery of the lost efficiency.

#+CAPTION: Recorded luminosity as a function of the run number, for the 2017 data-taking period. The two $\metnomu$ triggers considered for the analysis in 2017 are shown. While the one with the $\httt$ cut (empty red circles) was not active in the first runs,  it collected all available luminosity once it was on. This enables to recover some luminosity lost by the trigger shown in blue crosses, as one can see by looking at the last few runs, where a discrepancy exists. We consider the \logicor{} of the two triggers in the analysis.

#+CAPTION: $\metnomu$ data and MC trigger efficiencies (top panels) and corresponding \acp{SF} (lower panels), for 2017. The left (right) plot was obtained in the \mumu (\mutau{}) channel as described in the text. The \mumu{} channel is used for validation, while \mumu is used to extract the analysis \acp{SF}. \acp{SF} are extracted from the ratio of the data and MC sigmoid fits, implemented to smoothen the \ac{SF}'s distribution. They are taken to be one for $\metnomu$ values above \SI{350}{\GeV}.
