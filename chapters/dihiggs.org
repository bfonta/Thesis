* Motivation for di-Higgs searches
+ The measurement of Higgs properties at the LHC are in general challenging, given the low cross-sections involved
+ The production of Higgs boson pairs (HH) at the LHC is the main handle for the measurement of the Higgs boson interaction with itself and is thus a fundamental test of the Standard Model theory as well as for determining the Higgs potential.

** Non-resonant
+ $k_{\lambda}$ is one of the least constrained properties of the Higgs
+ The shape of the Higgs potential is completely determined by $m_{H}$, $v$ and the self-coupling of the Higgs (see Eq. [[eq:sm_potential]])
+ Measurements of $\lambda_{3}$ (or equivalently $k_{\lambda}$) provide a unique consistency test of the SM and also valuable information concerning the shape of the scalar potential (some consequences are discussed in Section [[sec:EWPT]])
+ The most up-to-date Run2 HH combination constrains the observed (expected) HH cross-section to $\xshh < 3.4 (2.5) \xshhsm$, where the sensitivity is dominated by the $4b$, $bb\tau\tau$ and $bb\gamma\gamma$ channels. The limit is also interpreted as a function of the $\kl$ and $\k2v$ coupling modifiers, measuring $-1.24 < \kl < 6.49$ and $0.67 < \kvv < 1.38$, respectively. Importantly, the latter result allows the exclusion of $\kvv=0$ at 6.6 standard deviations.

#+CAPTION: Upper limits at 95% confidence level on the SM signal strength $\mu = \xshh / \xshhsm$. The inner (green) band and the outer (yellow) bands indicate the regions containing 68% and 95%, respectively, of the limits on $\mu$ expected under the background-only hypothesis. The quoted expected upper limits are evaluated with the postfit values of the uncertainties. Figure taken from [[cite:&summary_hig_twiki]].

#+CAPTION: Combined expected and observed 95% CL upper limits on the HH production cross-section for different values of $\kl$, assuming the SM values for the modifiers of Higgs boson couplings to top quarks and vector bosons. The green and yellow bands represent the 1$\sigma$ and 2$\sigma$ extensions beyond the expected limit, respectively; the red solid line (band) shows the theoretical prediction for the HH production cross-section (its 1$\sigma$ uncertainty). The areas to the left and to the right of the hatched regions are excluded at the 95% CL. Taken from [[cite:&higgs_10_years]].
