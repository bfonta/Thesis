* Motivation for di-Higgs searches
In the SM, the Higgs self-coupling is uniquely determined by the structure of the scalar potential in [[eq:sm_potential]].
Experimentally measuring $\klc$ and $\klfour$ is thus a crucial test of the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking [[cite:&deFlorian:2227475]].
A direct measurement of $\klc$ requires double Higgs boson production while $\klfour$ is first probed in the production of 3 Higgs bosons.

The phenomenology of multi-Higgs boson final states will provide complementary information to that found from single Higgs physics at the LHC.
Due to the generally small inclusive cross sections and a difficult signal vs. background discrimination, the best motivated multi-Higgs final states at the \ac{LHC} are Higgs boson pair final states, of which gluon fusion is the dominant production mode.

Many models of physics beyond the Standard Model with \ac{SM}-compatible single Higgs boson signal strengths can exhibit a di-Higgs phenomenology vastly different from the \ac{SM} expectation.
In this sense, a successful discovery of Higgs boson pair production at the LHC and the subsequent measurement of potential deviations from the \ac{SM} constitute an important avenue in the search for physics beyond the \ac{SM}.

To facilitate such a measurement, it is crucial to establish the Higgs boson pair production cross section in the \ac{SM} to the best theoretical accuracy possible and to provide \ac{BSM} benchmarks that reflect the phenomenology of Higgs boson pairs at the LHC in a consistent and concise fashion.

Both the \ac{CMS} and the \ac{ATLAS} experiments at the \ac{LHC} are involved in a comprehensive study of diHiggs processes.

+ The measurement of Higgs properties at the LHC are in general challenging, given the low cross-sections involved
+ The production of Higgs boson pairs (HH) at the LHC is the main handle for the measurement of the Higgs boson interaction with itself and is thus a fundamental test of the Standard Model theory as well as for determining the Higgs potential.

** Non-resonant
+ $k_{\lambda}$ is one of the least constrained properties of the Higgs
+ The shape of the Higgs potential is completely determined by $\mh_{}$, $v$ and the self-coupling of the Higgs (see [[eq:sm_potential]])
+ Measurements of $\lambda_{3}$ (or equivalently $k_{\lambda}$) provide a unique consistency test of the SM and also valuable information concerning the shape of the scalar potential (some consequences are discussed in Section [[sec:EWPT]])
+ The most up-to-date Run2 HH combination constrains the observed (expected) HH cross-section to $\xshh < 3.4\;(2.5)\;\xshhsm$, where the sensitivity is dominated by the $4b$, $bb\tau\tau$ and $bb\gamma\gamma$ channels. The limit is also interpreted as a function of the $\kl$ and $\k2v$ coupling modifiers, measuring $-1.24 < \kl < 6.49$ and $0.67 < \kvv < 1.38$, respectively. Importantly, the latter result allows the exclusion of $\kvv=0$ at 6.6 standard deviations.
