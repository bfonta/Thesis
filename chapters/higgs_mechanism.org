@Explain how the non-zero value of the Higgs field that permeates the Universe breaks electro-weak symmetry (related to the EWPT section)@

At low energy the potential $V$ associated to the Higgs boson field $H$ in the SM Lagrangian can be expressed as:

#+NAME: eq:sm_potential
\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{2} m_{H}^{2 }H^{2} + \lambda_{3}vH^{3} + \frac{\lambda_{4}}{4}H^{4}
\end{equation}

\noindent Continue here.

Another paragraph show [[eq:sm_potential]].
