Following the end of the Second World War, there was the need for Europe to stop the brain exodus to North America, and to establish a world-class research facility which could foster unity in post-war Europe.
The European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) was thus born in 1954, engaging in purely scientific endeavours, and excluding itself, as per its Convention [[cite:&CERNconvention]], from any connection to military actions, in a spirit of peace and open scientific exchange.

Home of many atomic and particle physics experiments, CERN is nowadays widely known by its huge particle accelerator, the \ac{LHC}, built with a designed center-of-massy energy of \SI{14}{\TeV}.
The \ac{LHC} sits at the border between France and Switzerland, close to Geneva, and spans an impressive \SI{27}{\kilo\meter} circumference of vacuum pipes, where beams of protons accelerate in opposite directions almost at the speed of light.
The same tunnel, located at a depth ranging between \num{45} and \SI{170}{\meter}, was formerly used for \ac{LHC}'s predecessor, \ac{LEP}, responsible for the precise measurement of the mass of the W and Z bosons, among other parameters.
\Ac{LHC}'s beams collide at four \acp{IP}, one of which is surrounded by the \ac{CMS} detector, a massive experiment which measures the properties of the decay products of such high-energy collisions, and which data serves as the basis for the thesis you are now reading.

This Chapter provides a condensed summary of the data production and processing taking place at the \ac{LHC} and \ac{CMS}, from circullating proton bunches to the definition of measured physics objects, used to extend our current knowledge on subatomic physics.
We describe the \ac{LHC} in [[#sec:lhc_intro]] and \ac{CMS} in [[#sec:cms_detector]].
Given the scope of the thesis, namely the trigger work described in later chapters, we cover the \ac{CMS} trigger system in detail in [[#sec:cms_trigger_system]], and provide a concise description of how offline object reconstruction works in [[#sec:offline_reco]].
We finalize the Chapter by discussing \ac{MC} generation within \ac{CMS}, also in light of the \ac{MC} activities developed within the timeframe of the thesis here reported.
