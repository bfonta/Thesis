The CMS experiment adopts a right-handed coordinate system, with the origin placed at the nominal collision point.
The x-axis points toward the centre of the LHC ring, the y-axis points vertically upward, and the z-axis thus points towards the Jura mountains.
The structure of the detector makes it natural to use a polar coordinate system.
The azimuthal angle $\phi$ is measured in the $x - y$ plane from the x-axis, the radial coordinate is given by $r$, and the polar angle $\theta$ is measured from the z-axis in the $y - z$ plane.
A schematic representation of the CMS coordinate system is shown in Fig. 2.5.
The relation between the Cartesian and the CMS coordinates is given by:

#+NAME: eq:xyzcoords
\begin{equation}
\begin{cases}
x = r \sin \theta \cos \phi \\
y = r \sin \theta \sin \phi \\
z = r \cos \theta
\end{cases}
\end{equation}

While this coordinate system is well suited for expressing the orientation of the detector and macroscopic observables, it is not ideal for describing proton-proton collisions.
A proton-proton collision is actually a parton-parton collision.
Protons, not being fundamental particles, are made of different constituents, named partons.
Consider a scenario where two protons collide head-on.
The four-momentum of the two partons can be written as:

#+NAME: eq:momenta
\begin{equation}
\begin{cases}
p^{\mu}_1 = (x_1E, 0, 0, x_1p) \\
p^{\mu}_2 = (x_2E, 0, 0, -x_2p) \\
\end{cases}
\end{equation}

In these four-vectors, $E$ and $p$ denote the energy and momentum of the proton, respectively.
The $x$ and $y$ components are null as protons are primarily accelerated longitudinally at high energies, leading to negligible transverse momentum for the partons inside them.
Consequently, the $x_1$ and $x_2$ variables can be interpreted as the fractions of energy that the partons carry away from the original protons.
After the collision, the resulting momentum is given by:

#+NAME: eq:pmomenta
\begin{equation}
(p_1 + p_2)^{\mu} = ((x_1 + x_2)E, 0, 0, (x_1 - x_2)p)
\end{equation}

The CMS frame is not the centre-of-mass frame of the collision.
The relativistic $\beta$ factor, in the high-energy limit where $E \approx p$, results to be:

#+NAME: eq:beta
\begin{equation}
\beta = \frac{x_1 - x_2}{x_1 + x_2}
\end{equation}

The $x_1$ and $x_2$ quantities are unknown and change from event to event, consequently also the related Lorentz-boost is unknown.
It is thus beneficial to use variables that are Lorentz-invariant for boosts along the longitudinal direction.
The par excellence observables are the transverse momentum $p_T$ and transverse mass $m_T$:

#+NAME: eq:transverse_momenta
\begin{equation}
\begin{cases}
p^2_T = p^2_x + p^2_y \\
m^2_T = m^2 + p^2_x + p^2_y = E^2 - p^2_z \\
\end{cases}
\end{equation}


From these variables, the transverse energy is defined as:
#+NAME: eq:transverse energy
\begin{equation}
E^2_T = m^2 + p^2_T
\end{equation}

which is equal to the transverse momentum for massless particles.
Another variable is the rapidity $y$:

#+NAME: eq:rapidity
\begin{equation}
y = \frac{1}{2} \ln \left( \frac{E + p_z}{E - p_z} \right)
\end{equation}

A Lorentz-boost along the z-axis shifts the rapidity by a constant term that depends on the boost itself.
The rapidity itself is thus not Lorentz-invariant; its difference is.
One of the advantages of using the rapidity is that particle production is roughly constant as a function of $y$.
For ultra-relativistic particles, the rapidity is usually converted to the pseudorapidity $\eta$:


#+NAME: eq:pseudo-rapidity
\begin{equation}
y \approx \frac{1}{2} \ln \left( \frac{E(1 + \cos \theta)}{E(1 - \cos \theta)} \right)
= -\frac{1}{2} \ln \left( \tan \left( \frac{\theta}{2} \right) \right)
\equiv \eta
\end{equation}

The pseudorapidity is a pure geometrical variable, depending only on the angle $\theta$.
It can be also used to define a Lorentz-invariant spatial separation between two particles:

#+NAME: eq:deltar
\begin{equation}
\Delta R = \sqrt{(\Delta \eta)^2 + (\Delta \phi)^2}
\end{equation}

Based on the $\eta$ coordinate, the detector is divided into a central part called barrel, and two forward parts called endcaps.
The exact $\eta$ value marking the transition between the two regions depends on the specific sub-detector.
