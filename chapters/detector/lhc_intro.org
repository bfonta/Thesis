The \ac{LHC} is one of the largest scientific instruments ever built, being the current most powerful particle accelerator in the world.
Designed to provide a maximum energy of \SI{6.8}{\TeV} per proton beam, it has gathered since its debut in 2010 a user community of \num{\sim 9000} scientists working in fundamental particle physics [[cite:&hllhc]].
The main purpose of the \ac{LHC} physics programme was to search for the Higgs boson and understand the mechanism of \ac{EWSB}, which we covered in [[#sec:higgs_mechanism]].
It was also meant to explore the $\si{TeV}$ scale, either via the existence of new resonances, or by indirect manifestation of higher-energy and yet unknown particles.
More broadly, the \ac{LHC} was put in place with the hope of finding asnwers to some of the most profound questions in modern physics, which were discussed in [[#sec:short_comings]].
Beyond its \ac{pp} collisions, the \ac{LHC} also collides lead ions, enabling the study of the /quark-gluon plasma/, an extremely dense and hot state of matter where quarks and gluons do not experience the strong force.
