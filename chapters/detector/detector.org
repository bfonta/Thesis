The  muon system has received a new component for \run{3}: the \ac{GEM} superchambers.
Covering $1.6<|\eta|<2.15$, the new subdetectors enhances the sensitivity of the muon trigger to soft prompt muon signatures and displaced muon signatures from \ac{NP} with \acp{LLP}, increasing leverage to the muon bending angle.
Each \ac{GEM} chamber is made of three \ac{GEM} foils, and in total \num{36} superchambers have  been installed, where one superchamber is made of two chambers and covers \num{10} degrees in \ac{phi}.
The greatest benefit of the early installation of the GE1/1 is to improve the \ac{L1}
muon trigger during \ac{LHC} running before the installation of a new silicon tracker and its associated trigger [[cite:&gem_trigger_data_format;&gem_tdr]].

#+CAPTION: Schematic longitudinal view of a quadrant of the R-z cross-section of the \ac{CMS} detector during the \ac{HL-LHC}. All muon subdetector are shown, including future additions: \acp{DT} (yellow), \acp{CSC} (green), \acp{RPC} and \acp{GEM}. Additions on the muon side feature the GE2/1 and \ac{ME0} superchambers, which are part of \acp{GEM}, and the \acp{iRPC}. \ac{ME0} will be installed on the back of \ac{HGCAL}. Pseudorapidity values are given with dashed lines, and some values are highlighted. Adapted from [[cite:&gem_tdr]].
