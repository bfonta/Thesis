They are designed to be versatile and capable of detecting a wide range of physics processes across various energies.
The CMS experiment was officially proposed in 1992 with the primary goal of discovering the \textbf{Higgs boson}.
Key to this objective were the channels $H \rightarrow ZZ \rightarrow 4\ell$ and $H \rightarrow \gamma\gamma$, which required an excellent electromagnetic calorimeter for effective electron and photon detection, with an energy resolution constant term equal to or less than \textbf{0.5\%}.

The architecture of the CMS detector is depicted in Figure 2.7.
It is a cylindrical apparatus with a length of $21.6\,m$ and a diameter of $14.6\,m$, comprising a central section known as the barrel, and two forward sections termed endcaps.
The precise demarcation between these regions varies according to the specific subdetectors in question.

To fulfill its versatile objectives, the CMS detector is outfitted with an intricate configuration of concentric detection layers.
Each layer is tailored to identify the various particles produced by collision events.
At the heart of this configuration, the pixel and strip tracker detectors, which encircle the interaction point, ascertain the location of collision vertices.
These detectors further delineate the trajectories and momenta of charged particles emanating from the collisions.
Encasing these trackers, the electromagnetic and hadron calorimeters gauge the energy imparted to their active material by electrons, photons, and hadrons, thereby facilitating precise energy quantification.
Enveloping the calorimeters, the CMS superconducting solenoid stands as the experiment's most salient characteristic.
The outermost layer is formed by the muon tracking chambers, which encompass the entire CMS volume.

Redundancy in the data from the various subdetectors is intentional, to maximize the accuracy of measurements for all types of final-state particles.
The subsequent sections detail the individual components of the CMS detector.
The application of this data in the offline reconstruction of physics objects is elaborated in Section 2.4.

A high-efficiency central tracking system was another fundamental requirement.
The tracker is essential for momentum measurement, particle identification, and vertex reconstruction.
To achieve precise momentum measurement, a powerful magnet was necessary, leading to the use of superconducting technology.
The CMS detector's structure and components are designed to meet these stringent requirements.
