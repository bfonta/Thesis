They are designed to be versatile and capable of detecting a wide range of physics processes across various energies.
The CMS experiment was officially proposed in 1992 with the primary goal of discovering the Higgs boson.
Key to this objective were the channels $H \rightarrow ZZ \rightarrow 4\ell$ and $H \rightarrow \gamma\gamma$, which required an excellent electromagnetic calorimeter for effective electron and photon detection, with an energy resolution constant term equal to or less than 0.5%.

The architecture of the CMS detector is depicted in Figure 2.7.
It is a cylindrical apparatus with a length of $21.6\,m$ and a diameter of $14.6\,m$, comprising a central section known as the barrel, and two forward sections termed endcaps.
The precise demarcation between these regions varies according to the specific subdetectors in question.

To fulfill its versatile objectives, the CMS detector is outfitted with an intricate configuration of concentric detection layers.
Each layer is tailored to identify the various particles produced by collision events.
At the heart of this configuration, the pixel and strip tracker detectors, which encircle the interaction point, ascertain the location of collision vertices.
These detectors further delineate the trajectories and momenta of charged particles emanating from the collisions.
Encasing these trackers, the electromagnetic and hadron calorimeters gauge the energy imparted to their active material by electrons, photons, and hadrons, thereby facilitating precise energy quantification.
Enveloping the calorimeters, the CMS superconducting solenoid stands as the experiment's most salient characteristic.
The outermost layer is formed by the muon tracking chambers, which encompass the entire CMS volume.

Redundancy in the data from the various subdetectors is intentional, to maximize the accuracy of measurements for all types of final-state particles.
The subsequent sections detail the individual components of the CMS detector.
The application of this data in the offline reconstruction of physics objects is elaborated in Section 2.4.

A high-efficiency central tracking system was another fundamental requirement.
The tracker is essential for momentum measurement, particle identification, and vertex reconstruction.
To achieve precise momentum measurement, a powerful magnet was necessary, leading to the use of superconducting technology.
The CMS detector's structure and components are designed to meet these stringent requirements.
In the following, we describe all subdetectors in detail.

\myparagraph{Electromagnetic calorimeter}

@TODO@
The CMS ECAL is a scintillating lead-tungstate crystal calorimeter, with a silicon strip preshower detector in the forward region that provides precise measurements of the energy and the time-of-arrival of electrons and photons.
The electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL) of the CMS detector provides a highly efficient and accurate reconstruction of photons and electrons over a wide range of energies from low-energy electrons (5 GeV) typical of multilepton events, to electroweak-scale energies (Higgs and W/Z bosons), up to the
TeV scale typical of high-mass resonance searches. The ECAL also measures energy deposits
from hadrons and the electromagnetic component of jets contributing to jet energy and missing
transverse momentum (pmissT ) measurements. The ECAL provides precise time-of-arrival mea-
surements of electromagnetic showers, used in the rejection of backgrounds with a broad time
distribution, such as electronic noise and pp interactions in preceding and subsequent bunch
crossings. Precise time measurements can be used to identify new particles with long lifetimes,
typically larger than 1 ns, predicted by certain theories beyond the standard model [[cite:&performance_calorimeter_trigger]].


\myparagraph{Muon Chambers}

\Ac{CMS} is specifically optimized for muon measurements, which are performed by \acp{DT} in the barrel region and \acp{CSC} in the forward region.
\Acp{RPC} are also available for triggering and redundancy.
The entire system is based on gaseous detectors, and is located outside the solenoid, where the distance to the \ac{PV} is large enough so that only muons are expected.
Indeed, muons produced at the \ac{LHC}, with energies ranging from a few \si{\MeV} to several \si{\GeV}, are the closest a particle becomes from being a \ac{MIP} (see [[ref:fig:muon_dedx]]), and thus traverse large quantities of matter remaining mostly undisturbed.
In particular, they are not stopped by the calorimeters.
We note that muons have a mass \num{\sim 200} times larger than the electrons, rendering bremsstrahlung effect comparatively minor.
The barrel section of the muon chambers is composed of four muon stations interleaved with the steel return yoke, which provide mechanical support.
The \SI{\sim 1.8}{\tesla} magnetic return flux can thus be used to measure muon momenta, independently from the tracker.
A dedicated muon based trigger is thus possible, and combined muon position and $\pt$ measurements with the tracker becomes a very powerful tool.
However, the extreme proximity to the return yoke also creates negative effects, namely the presence of \ac{EM} showers induced by muon bremsstrahlung, which degrades momentum resolution.
A highly redundant muon system is therefore found ideal to preserve physics performance.
We can indeed find \acp{RPC} present both in the barrel, together with \acp{DT}, and in the endcaps, with \acp{CSC}.
The redundancy also plays a role in reducing the impact from acceptance blind spots introduced by the support mechanisms and cabling of such large detectors cite:&trigger_tdr_phase1_vol1.
The structure of the muon chambers, including future upgrades, is shown in [[ref:fig:cms_muon_slice]].

Muons produced at the \ac{LHC} behave similarly to \acp{MIP}. Solid curves indicate the total stopping power. Vertical bands indicate boundaries between different approximations. The mass stopping power in the radiative region is not simply a function of $\beta\gamma$. Further discussion available in [[cite:&PDG Chpt. 34]], where the figure was taken.

\paragraph{Drift Tubes:}
Present in the barrel section, they consist on drift chambers aiming at providing position resolutions of the order of \SI{100}{\micro\meter}.
A single \SI{4}{\cm}-wide tube contains a stretched wire within a gas volume.
When a charged particle passes through the gas, it knocks electrons off the gas atoms.
The electrons drift along the electric field's direction, reaching the anode and producing a signal.
The \acp{DT} ensure a constant drift velocity along the entire drift path, which enables the identification of the two-dimensional point in space where the charged particle, a muon in this context, crossed.
Each \ac{DT} module range from \num{2}\times\SI{2.5}{\meter\squared} to \num{4}\times\SI{2.5}{\meter\squared} in size, and is composed of two or three \acp{SL}.
Each module contains in turn four \ch{Al} layers of staggered \acp{DT}.
A \ac{SL} thus provides four two-dimensional points to measure the muon's position.
\Acp{SL} within a module are aligned in two perpendicular directions, which allows a three-dimensional measurement of the position of the muon track.

\paragraph{Cathode Strip Chambers:}
Stationed in the endcaps, \acp{CSC} consist of arrays of positively-charged wires perpendicular to negatively-charged \ch{Cu} strips, all within a gas volume.
When muons pass through, electrons get knocked off the gas atoms.
Both displaced electrons and ions follow the electric field, inducing signals in the wires and strips, respectively.
The relative positioning of wires and strips enables a 2D position measurement for each passing muon.
The existence of six layers per \ac{CSC} module significantly increases the precision of the measurement.
The resolution for one layer is in the \num{80} to \SI{450}{\micro\meter} range, and approaches \SI{50}{\micro\meter} when combined.

\paragraph{Resistive Plate Chambers:}
They are present in both the barrel and in the endcap, and provide trigger redundancy with respect to \acp{DT} and \acp{CSC}.
\Acp{RPC} are made of two parallel plates defining an electric field separated by a thin gas volume.
Like for the other muon detectors, when muons pass through an \ac{RPC}, they knock out some of the gas electrons, creating electron avalanches.
Those electrons traverse the plates without interacting and, after a precisely known time delayt, are picked up by external metallic strips.
This provides a good spatial resolution and a time resolution of \SI{1}{\nano\second}.
All muon stations are equipped with at least one \ac{RPC}, but two are present in the inner barrel to compensate for the lower resolution of low $\pt$ muons.
The additional resolution extends the \ac{CMS} trigger low-$\pt$ reach to \SI{\sim 4}{\GeV} in the barrel and \SI{\sim 2}{\GeV} in the endcaps.

\paragraph{Gas Electron Multipliers:}
A first batch of 144 \ac{GEM} chambers was introduced in the \ac{CSM} muon system during \longshut{2}.
They are located very close to the beampipe, subject to the highest radiation doses among all muon detectors.
The \acp{GEM} system will improve the measurement of the polar muon bending angle, extending current trigger capabilities.
The detectors have a \ac{GEM} foil, consisting of a \SI{50}{\micro\meter}-thick insulating polymer covered on both sides by thin \ch{Cu} conductive layers.
A strong electric field is applied between the two conductors.
Each \ac{GEM} chamber includes a stack of three \ac{GEM} foils.
The chambers are filled with an \ch{Ar}/\ch{CO2} mixture, which is ionized by incident muons, and are segmented in strips along \phi{}.
The electrons created during the ionisation process drift towards the foils create avalanches.
The resulting electron avalanche induces a readout signal on the finely spaced strips.
The structure of the chambers and its location in the \ac{CMS} endcap can be seen in [[ref:fig:gem_structure]].
The CMS GEMs are the largest \ac{GEM} system ever installed, with an area of \SI{\sim 0.5}{\meter\squared} per chamber.
They bring a spatial resolution of \num{30} to \SI{100}{\micro\meter} and a timing resolution of \SI{\sim 5}{\nano\second} [[cite:&gem_tdr]].
