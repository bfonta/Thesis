@mention impact of bb\tau\tau@

The most up-to-date Run2 HH combination constrains the observed (expected) HH cross-section to $\xshh < 3.4\;(2.5)\;\xshhsm$, where the sensitivity is dominated by the $4b$, $bb\tau\tau$ and $bb\gamma\gamma$ channels. The limit is also interpreted as a function of the $\kl$ and $\k2v$ coupling modifiers, measuring $-1.24 < \kl < 6.49$ and $0.67 < \kvv < 1.38$, respectively. Importantly, the latter result allows the exclusion of $\kvv=0$ at 6.6 standard deviations.

#+CAPTION: Upper limits at 95% confidence level on the SM signal strength $\mu = \xshh / \xshhsm$. The inner (green) band and the outer (yellow) bands indicate the regions containing 68% and 95%, respectively, of the limits on $\mu$ expected under the background-only hypothesis. The quoted expected upper limits are evaluated with the postfit values of the uncertainties. Figure taken from [[cite:&summary_hig_twiki]].

#+ATTR_LATEX: :width .85\textwidth
#+CAPTION: 95% confidence intervals on $\kl$ superimposed by the best fit value on this parameter. The blue (black) hashed band indicates the observed (expected) excluded regions, respectively. The band around the best fit value corresponds to the one sigma interval. The quoted expected upper limits are evaluated with the postfit values of the uncertainties.

#+NAME: fig:scan_kl_nature
#+ATTR_LATEX: :width .9\textwidth
#+CAPTION: Combined expected and observed 95% CL upper limits on the HH production cross-section for different values of $\kl$, assuming the SM values for the modifiers of Higgs boson couplings to top quarks and vector bosons. The green and yellow bands represent the 1$\sigma$ and 2$\sigma$ extensions beyond the expected limit, respectively; the red solid line (band) shows the theoretical prediction for the HH production cross-section (its 1$\sigma$ uncertainty). The areas to the left and to the right of the hatched regions are excluded at the 95% CL. Taken from [[cite:&higgs_10_years]].
