@mention impact of bb\tau\tau@

The most up-to-date Run2 HH combination constrains the observed (expected) HH cross-section to $\xshh < 3.4\;(2.5)\;\xshhsm$, where the sensitivity is dominated by the $4b$, $bb\tau\tau$ and $bb\gamma\gamma$ channels. The limit is also interpreted as a function of the $\kl$ and $\k2v$ coupling modifiers, measuring $-1.24 < \kl < 6.49$ and $0.67 < \kvv < 1.38$, respectively. Importantly, the latter result allows the exclusion of $\kvv=0$ at 6.6 standard deviations.

#+CAPTION: Upper limits at 95% confidence level on the SM signal strength $\mu = \xshh / \xshhsm$. The inner (green) band and the outer (yellow) bands indicate the regions containing 68% and 95%, respectively, of the limits on $\mu$ expected under the background-only hypothesis. The quoted expected upper limits are evaluated with the postfit values of the uncertainties. Figure taken from [[cite:&summary_hig_twiki]].

The blue (black) hashed band indicates the observed (expected) excluded regions, respectively. The band around the best fit value corresponds to the one sigma interval. The quoted expected upper limits are evaluated with the postfit values of the uncertainties. Taken from

#+CAPTION: Combined expected and observed 95% CL upper limits on the HH production cross-section for different values of $\kl$ (left) and $\kvv$ (right), assuming the SM values for the modifiers of Higgs boson couplings to top quarks and vector bosons. The green and yellow bands represent the 1$\sigma$ and 2$\sigma$ extensions beyond the expected limit, respectively; the red solid line (band) shows the theoretical prediction for the HH production cross-section (its 1$\sigma$ uncertainty). The areas to the left and to the right of the hatched regions are excluded at the 95% CL. Taken from [[cite:&higgs_10_years]].

#+CAPTION: Observed (solid lines) and expected (dashed lines) 95% CL exclusion limits on the HH production cross-sections of the inclusive \ac{ggF} and \ac{VBF} processes as a function of $\kl$ (left) and the \ac{VBF} process as a function of $\kvv$ (right), for the \bbgg{} (purple), \bbtt{} (green), multilepton (cyan), \bbbb{} (blue) and \bbll{} (brown) decay channels and their combination (black). The expected limits assume no HH production or no \ac{VBF} HH production, respectively. The \ac{ggF} HH production cross-section is assumed to be as predicted by the SM in the right plot. The red line shows the theory prediction for the \ac{ggF} and \ac{VBF} HH production cross-section as a function of $\kl$ (left), and the predicted \ac{VBF} HH cross-section as a function of $\kvv$ (right). The bands surrounding the red cross-section lines indicate the theoretical uncertainties on the predicted cross-sections. Taken from [[cite:&atlas_hh_comb]].

The \ac{ggF} or \ac{VBF} HH production cross-section is fixed to the SM predicted value for $\mh=125\,\si{\GeV}$ when deriving limits on the respective signal strength. The expected limit, along with the ±1σ and ±2σ bands, is calculated under the assumption of no HH process and with all NPs profiled to the observed data. Taken from [[cite:&atlas_hh_comb]].

The expected limits from the \bbtt{}, \bbgg{} and \bbbb{} decay channels are presented as well. Theoretical predictions, estimated using specific sets of coefficient values defined in the benchmarks, are shown as red cross dots. Taken from [[cite:&atlas_hh_comb]].
