+ The $k_\lambda$ can be additionally constrained exploiting NLO electro-weak corrections to single-H which depend on $k_\lambda$.
+ Single-H cross-sections are quite sensitive to $k_{\lambda}$ variations, especially in the VH and ttH production modes ($\pm 10\%$ in the latter)
+ Complementarity: searches for HH generally provide weaker contraints on the Higgs boson coupling to fermions and vector bosons, when compared to single-H, due to the lower production cross-section. HH, on the other hand, provide stronger constraints on $k_{\lambda}$.
+ Combination of event categories from both single and double-Higgs analysis enables the extraction of additional constraints on $k_\lambda$
+ ATLAS result [[cite:&ATLASHplusHHcomb]]: $-0.4 < k_{\lambda} < 6.3$ assuming other Higgs couplings to be equal to the SM, or $-1.4 < k_{\lambda} < 6.1$ otherwise
+ Main challenge: estimate and efficiently remove overlaps between the signal regions of different analysis. This improves the constraints on $k_{\lambda}$ by mitigating double-counting and minimizing uncertainties coming from the overlaps.
+ The analysis with the most sensitive production modes are included
+ Whenever overlaps exist, one of two approaches is taken: either additional selections are applied, or the least sensitive category or analysis is removed. As an example, the $HH \rightarrow bbZZ$ analysis is removed in favour of $H \rightarrow ZZ \rightarrow 4l$ due to the former's relatively low sensitivity to $k_{\lambda}$
+ The modelling of systematics in HH processes is generally simpler due to the limited statistics in those analysis.
+ CMS result [[cite:&CMSHplusHHcomb]]: $-0.4 < k_{\lambda} < 6.3$ assuming other Higgs couplings to be equal to the SM, or $-1.4 < k_{\lambda} < 6.1$ otherwise

+ The most up-to-date Run2 HH combination constrains the observed (expected) HH cross-section to $\xshh < 3.4\;(2.5)\;\xshhsm$, where the sensitivity is dominated by the $4b$, $bb\tau\tau$ and $bb\gamma\gamma$ channels. The limit is also interpreted as a function of the $\kl$ and $\k2v$ coupling modifiers, measuring $-1.24 < \kl < 6.49$ and $0.67 < \kvv < 1.38$, respectively. Importantly, the latter result allows the exclusion of $\kvv=0$ at 6.6 standard deviations.

#+CAPTION: Upper limits at 95% confidence level on the SM signal strength $\mu = \xshh / \xshhsm$. The inner (green) band and the outer (yellow) bands indicate the regions containing 68% and 95%, respectively, of the limits on $\mu$ expected under the background-only hypothesis. The quoted expected upper limits are evaluated with the postfit values of the uncertainties. Figure taken from [[cite:&summary_hig_twiki]].

#+CAPTION: Combined expected and observed 95% CL upper limits on the HH production cross-section for different values of $\kl$, assuming the SM values for the modifiers of Higgs boson couplings to top quarks and vector bosons. The green and yellow bands represent the 1$\sigma$ and 2$\sigma$ extensions beyond the expected limit, respectively; the red solid line (band) shows the theoretical prediction for the HH production cross-section (its 1$\sigma$ uncertainty). The areas to the left and to the right of the hatched regions are excluded at the 95% CL. Taken from [[cite:&higgs_10_years]].
