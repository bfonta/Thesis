\ac{CMS} has recently explored the extremely rare \gamma\gamma\tau\tau decay channel, for the first time, using full Run2 data.
The analysis covers non-resonant production via \ac{ggF} and the HH (spin 0 and 2) and HY \ac{BSM} resonant production modes.
The latter particle refers to an additional BSM scalar Y, considering both H(bb)Y(\tau\tau) and H(\tau\tau)Y(bb) signatures.
Despite the minuscule HH branching ratio of 0.028%, the analysis presents interesting specificities worth discussing.
Given the scope of these proceedings, in the following we discuss the nonresonant analysis only.

The analysis exploits di-$\gamma$ triggers only, as triggering on the \tau's is found to have a negligible impact.
Standard photon and lepton selections are applied.
The dominant backgrounds are peaking single-H and nonresonant \gamma+jets, \gamma\gamma+jets, $\ttbar+\gamma$, $\ttbar+\gamma\gamma$, V\gamma.
Minor backgrounds are taken from simulation.
The signal is fitted independently for different categories and data taking years with a double Crystal Ball function.
The background also includes a $H\rightarrow \gamma\gamma$ contribution which is modelled just like the signal.
The background continuum, instead, uses the discrete profiling method [[cite:&discrete_profiling]], which considers multiple analytical functions and penalizes functions with many parameters.

Interestingly, \tauâ€™s are reconstructed in all its 6 decay modes ($ee$, $\mu\mu$, $e\mu$, $e\tau_{h}$, $\mu\tau_{h}$ and $\tau_{h}\tau_{h}$), and additionally the single $\tau_{h}$ and $\tau_{h}+\text{track}$ channels are considered when no electorn or muon pass the selection.
Multiple selections are used, including a DY window mass veto to events cmpatible with $Z\rightarrow ll$ or $Z\rightarrow ll\gamma$ close to the mass of the Z.

A \ac{BDT} is used, considering as input features related to the events' kinematical properties.
To avoid artificially creating a peaking structure in the di-\gamma mass ($m_{\gamma\gamma}$), which is used in the final fit, the \ac{BDT} is made independent of $m_{\gamma\gamma}$ at first order.
This is achieved by not using $m_{\gamma\gamma}$ as an input to the \ac{BDT} and by dividing the $p_{T}$ of photon candidates by $m_{\gamma\gamma}$.
Sequential boundaries are applied to the \ac{BDT}'s output to create two categories of different signal purities.
The splitting maximizes signal sensitivity.
Events not belonging to one of those two categories are discarded.

The final results are obtained performing a simultaneous maximum likelihood fit to $m_{\gamma\gamma}$ in the two signal-enriched categories.
As expected by a SM behaviour, the analysis observed very few \gamma\gamma\tau\tau candidates.
However, it delivers observed (expected) $\kl$ 95% confidence level upper limits, $-13\;(-11) < k_{\lambda} < 18\;(16)$, and on the HH proton-proton cross-section, $\sigma_{\text{HH}} < 930\;(740)\;\si{\femto\barn}$ or $\sigma_{\text{HH}} < 33\;(26)\;\sigma_{\text{HH}}^{\text{SM}}$.
The limits are around one order of magnitude worse than the ones obtained by the most sensitive channels.
