<<sec::NonResBSMHH>>

Many models of physics beyond the Standard Model with \ac{SM}-compatible single Higgs boson signal strengths can exhibit a di-Higgs phenomenology vastly different from the \ac{SM} expectation.
In this sense, a successful discovery of Higgs boson pair production at the LHC and the subsequent measurement of potential deviations from the \ac{SM} constitute an important avenue in the search for physics beyond the \ac{SM}.

To facilitate such a measurement, it is crucial to establish the Higgs boson pair production cross section in the \ac{SM} to the best theoretical accuracy possible and to provide \ac{BSM} benchmarks that reflect the phenomenology of Higgs boson pairs at the LHC in a consistent and concise fashion.
