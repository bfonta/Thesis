<<sec:DiHiggs>>

As mentioned in [[sec:SM]], the \ac{SM} has proven an immensely successful theory.
However, some processes, either due to their low available event statistics or to a challenging experimental signature, are yet to be measured.
The production of Higgs boson pairs is one of such cases, given its extreme rarity (see [[sec:production]]), in addition generally involving complicated final states including multiple decay products with jets and/or \ac{MET}.

As seen in [[sec:HiggsMechanism]], one of the central pieces of the SM is the Higgs potential (see [[eq:sm_potential]]), where the triple and quartic Higgs couplings play a significant role.
In the \ac{SM}, the Higgs self-coupling $\klthree$ is uniquely determined by the structure of the scalar potential in [[eq:sm_potential]], and represents the potential's last missing piece from an experimental point of view.
Indeed, the potential is completely determined by the mass of the Higgs $\mh$, the vacuum expectation value $v$, and $\klthree$, where both $\mh$ and $v$ have already been measured.

Measurements of $\klthree$ (or equivalently $\kl$) and $\klfour$ therefore provide a unique consistency test of the \ac{SM}, representing a fundamental and crucial test of the \ac{EWSB} mechanism [[cite:&deFlorian:2227475]].
Furthermore, and as discussed in [[sec:EWPT]], a Higgs potential deviating from its SM expectation can have dramatic consequences for the understanding and destiny of the Universe.
Finally, as covered in [[sec:EWPT]], non-SM $\klthree$ might allow a \ac{SFO-EWPT} transition, which corresponds to the third Sakharov condition necessary for achieving the matter-antimatter asymmetry we observe today.

Both the \ac{CMS} and the \ac{ATLAS} experiments at the \ac{LHC} are involved in a comprehensive study of HH processes.
A direct measurement of $\klthree$ requires double Higgs boson production while $\klfour$ is first probed in the production of 3 Higgs bosons.
These quantities can also be measured indirectly, as detailed in [[sec:Combinations]].
$\kl$ is currently one of the least constrained properties of the Higgs boson.
