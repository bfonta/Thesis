As we can see in @insert figure reference@ for the \ac{DY} \ac{CR}, the data/MC agreement improves significantly when requiring a strong b-tag identification \ac{WP}.
This is due to bad modelization of the light jets coming with the \ac{DY} simulation, which has also been observed in the nonresonant \bbtt{} analysis [[cite:&higgs_bbtautau_nonres]].
Ultimately, the categories which matter are the ones being fitted, here the one where the ~DeepJet~ requirement is applied.
