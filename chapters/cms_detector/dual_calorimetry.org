* Hadron calorimeter issues
+ hadron component has many components, may $\pi^{0}$
+ the shower shape cannot be well defined, while EM showers have well defined shapes
+ many fluctuations, increase of EM component with energy, since as the enery increase one has more stages to which the decya particles can convert into EM components
  + the em shower fraction is mainly carried by $\pi^{0}$
+ invisible energy motly caused by free protons and neutrons from nuclei
  + limits the resolution
  + about 30/40% of the non-em shower energy component
+ response: detected signal per unit of energy deposit
  + response to EM and HAD is independent and generally different
  + overcompensation (HAD response larger than EM response) is possible with a lot of uranium, for instance

** Compensation
+ e/h=1 -> compensation
+ one can tune the active-to-passive ratio to control the compensation
  + adding uranium or hydrogen increases 'h', for instance
+ photoelectric effect has a Z^5 dependence in high-Z absorbers
+ does not guarantee higher resolution
+ high-Z required
+ low sampling fration required
+ high-res em and high-res hadron calorimeter are mutually exclusive (slide 15)

* Dual read-out calorimeter
+ correction event-by-event
+ consists on cherenkov + scintillation (Cherenkov only measures the EM component)
+ enables better reconstruction of total shower energy and fraction of EM energy

  
* RD52 results
+ PID improves, above 99% electron efficiency
+ observed 10% (50%) of the energy of a EM shower fits within 1mm (1cm) around the shower axis!

* IDEA
+ tried dual calorimeter with crystals: with PMT the light yield was too low, so Cherenkov did not work
+ currently around 50M fibers (less than 100M originally considered) in the calorimeter
+ fancy DNNs show that a very significant performance boost comes from additional dual read-out calorimetry variables
