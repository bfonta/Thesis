Having defined a final discriminant and the systematic uncertainties that might impact the analysis, all ingredients are in place to extract the final result.
This is the task of the statistical treatment, which in this Thesis is the now standard /modified frequentist approach/, a statistical method originally developed for Higgs boson searches at \ac{LEP} [[cite:&cls1]].
Since then, it has been extensively used by searches and combinations from the \ac{LHC} experiments, notably for the combination paper reporting the observation of the Higgs boson [[cite:&asimov;&stat_procedure_comb_higgs]].
Central to the approach is the much older concept of /hypothesis testing/, which is introduced in [[#sec:hypotheses]].
We then provide a short description of the Neyman-Pearson Lemma in [[#sec:lemma]] which, together, with the concept of likelihood maximization described in [[#sec:likelihood]], forms the basis of the definition of the test statistics used in \ac{HEP}, and which is described in [[#sec:cls]].
We conclude by explaining in [[#sec:exp_vs_obs]] the difference between expected and observed results, and why the most signal-sensitive data regions are not analyzed until well into the final stages of a \ac{HEP} study.
