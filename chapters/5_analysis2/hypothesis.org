In statistics, the term /hypothesis/ refers to a statement one can make based on the agreement of the observed data with a given predictive model [[cite:&glen_cowan]].
The hypothesis being assessed is traditionally called the /null hypothesis/, or $H_{0}$, against which a series of /atlernative/ hypotheses can be compared: $H_{1}$, $H_{2}$, $H_{3}$, ...
Hypothesis denote \acp{PDF} $f(x;\theta)$ which depend on the measured data $x = (x_1,x_2,x_3,...)$ and potentially on free parameters $\theta = (\theta_1,\theta_2,\theta_3,...)$ which are estimated from data.
To measure the agreement between a given hypothesis and the data being measured, one constructs a function of the variables being measured, called /test statistic/, or $t(x;\theta)$.
Each hypothesis implies a different \ac{PDF} for the test statistic, denoted as $g(t|H_0)$, $g(t|H_1)$, $g(t|H_2)$, ...
One usually tries to construct the simplest test statistic enabling the largest discrimination possible between the hypotheses being compared.
In order to accept or reject a given $H_0$, one has to define a test statistic /cut/ $\tcut$ establishing an acceptance and a rejection region.
The decision is then made by comparing the observed value of $t(x;\theta)$ with the $\tcut$ previously defined.
When the value of $t(x;\theta)$ is within the acceptance region, the null hypothesis is said to be /accepted/; otherwise, it is /rejected/.
Naturally, $\tcut$ can be arbitrarily chosen, affecting the sizes of the acceptance and rejection regions.
In general, $\tcut$ is defined so to provide a significance level $\alpha$ according to some common threshold, oftentimes 5% or 10%:

#+NAME: eq:significance_level
\begin{equation}
\alpha = \int_{\tcut}^{\infty} g(t|H_{0})dt \: .
\end{equation}

\noindent The larger $\alpha$, the harder it becomes to reject $H_0$, and the smaller become /false negatives/, where $H_0$ is rejected despite being true.
Conversely, the probability for the $H_0$ to be accepted given that $H_1$ is true is called a /false positive/, and is given by:

#+NAME: eq:inverse_power
\begin{equation}
\beta = \int_{-\infty}^{\tcut} g(t|H_{1})dt \: ,
\end{equation}

\noindent where $1-\beta$ is called the /power/ of the test.
The smaller $\tcut$ is, the smaller $\beta$ will become, creating a "powerful" test in what concerns the discrimination against alternative hypotheses.
