Measurements in all branches of Science consist of estimating one or more unknown parameters from observed data, which are later compared to existing models.
This process is called /statistical inference/, or just inference for short [[cite:&lista]].
The parameters one wishes to access can be categorized in two classes:
+ *Parameters of Interest*:
  Representing the end goal of the experiments, \acp{POI} define the underlying probability distributions analyses wish to measure.
  In our case, we want to know whether the observed data can be described by our signal models, on top of the expected background.
  This corresponds to the definition of a single \ac{POI} which scales the signal, the /signal strength modifier/ $\mu \equiv \sigma_{\text{obs.}}/\sigma_{\text{signal}}$.
  The signal is normalized to an arbitrary value, $\sigma\times\mathcal{B}=1\,\si{\pico\barn}$ in our case.
  Measuring $\mu \ne 0$ would indicate the presence of a \ac{BSM} signal.
  In [[#sec:likelihood]] we explain how this \ac{POI} is encoded in the maximum likelihood approach to extract the final results.
+ *Nuisance parameters*:
  The probability distributions connected to the observed data often depend on various effects not directly related to the \acp{POI}.
  The effects arise from the experimental apparatuses being used, such as for instance the limited resolution of a detector, miscalibrations, the existence of discrepancies between background models and real data, or the lack of sufficient events in simulations or data sidebands.
  The \acp{POI} can also depend on related theoretical predictions lacking sufficient precision.
  In order to measure the \acp{POI}, one has therefore to also measure additional unknown parameters, appropriately called /nuisances/.
  The integration of nuisances on the final result is also done with a dedicated statistical treatment based on the maximum likelihood approach.
  
Uncertainties related to the \acp{POI} caused by data fluctuations alone are denoted /statistical uncertainties/.
Instead, the propagation of the imperfect knowledge of all the elements of an analysis to the final result corresponds to /systematic uncertainties/, which are encoded via nuisances.
The careful measurement of systematics plays a central role in any physics analysis, since systematics can dramatically affect the sensitivity of the result.
In this section, we list the many sources of systematics considered.
Systematic uncertainties affecting only the yield of a given signal or background process are detailed in [[#sec:syst_norm]], and systematics also affecting the shape of the final discriminating variable are listed in [[#sec:syst_shape]].
