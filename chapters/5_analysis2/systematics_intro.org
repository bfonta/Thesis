Measurements in all branches of sciences consist of estimating one or more unknown parameters from the observed data, to be later compared to the models at hand.
This process is called /statistical inference/, or just inference for short [[cite:&lista]].
The parameters one wishes to access can be categorized in two classes:
+ *Parameters of Interest*:
  Representing the end goal of the experiments, \acp{POI} define the underlying probability distributions a particular analysis wishes to measure.
  In the case of the \xhhbbtt{} analysis, one wants to know whether the \spin{0} and \spin{2} models can describe the observed data, on top of the expected background.
  This corresponds to the definition of a single \ac{POI} which scales the signal, the /signal strength modifier/ $\mu \equiv \sigma_{\text{obs.}}/\sigma_{\text{signal}}$.
  The signal is normalized to an arbitrary value, $\sigma\times\mathcal{B}=1\,\si{\femto\barn}$ in our case.
  Measuring $\mu \ne 0$ would indicate the presence of a \ac{BSM} signal.
  In [[#sec:likelihood]] we explain how this \ac{POI} is encoded in the maximum likelihood approach to extract the final results.
+ *Nuisance parameters*:
  The probability distributions connected to the observed data often depend on various effects not directly related to the parameters one is interested about, the \acp{POI}.
  The effects arise from the experimental apparatuses being used, such as for instance the limited resolution of a detector, miscalibrations, the existence of discrepancies between background models and real data, or the lack of sufficient event in simulations or data sidebands.
  The \acp{POI} can also depend on rleated theoretical predictions lacking sufficient precision.
  In order to measure the \acp{POI}, one has therefore to also measure additional unknown parameters, appropriately called /nuisances/.
  The integration of nuisances on the final result is also done with a dedicated statistical treatment based on the maximum likelihood approach.
  
Uncertainties related to the \acp{POI} caused by data fluctuations alone are denoted /statistical uncertainties/.
Instead, the propagation of the imperfect knowledge of the analysis' nuisance parameters adds /systematic uncertainties/ to the final measurement.
The careful measurement of systematics plays a central role in any physics analysis, as they can dramatically affect the sensitivity of the result.
In this section we list the many sources of systematic uncertainties considered in the \xhhbbtt{} analysis that are included in the limit extraction described in [[#sec:final_limits]].
Systematic uncertainties affecting only the yield of a given signal or background process are detailed in [[#sec:syst_norm]], and systematics additionally affecting the shape of the final discriminating variable are listed in [[#sec:syst_shape]].
