+ compare also to HY analysis [[cite:&higgs_bbtautau_hy]]
+ Importantly, the results of this work hint at a the strongest limit than the one in [[fig:res_comb_xhh]], opening a window for further improvements in the combination, still with \run{2} data.

+ The reduction of the sensitivity around $\mx = 280\,\si{\GeV}$ is a consequence of the shape of the tt background, that peaks about this value,

* Pulls (maybe a different section??)
(copiado do Jona)
An important check to be performed is the control of the impact of the nuisance parameters on the result of the analysis by evaluating the so-called /pulls/ and /impacts/.
The pull is defined as the deviation of the value of $\hat{\theta}$ (ML estimator) with respect to its nominal value, divided by its uncertainty.
The impact is defined as the shift $\Delta\mu$ induced on the \ac{POI} when each nuisance is fixed to $\hat{\theta} \pm 1\,\sigma$, while all other nuisances are fixed to their maximum profiled likelihood estimate $\hat{\theta}$.
Show plot here if available.
