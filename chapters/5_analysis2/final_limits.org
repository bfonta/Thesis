+ compare also to HY analysis [[cite:&higgs_bbtautau_hy]]
+ Importantly, the results of this work hint at a the strongest limit than the one in [[fig:res_comb_xhh]], opening a window for further improvements in the combination, still with \run{2} data.
+ at \SI{1}{\TeV}, our result is a factor of 2 better than the result of \ac{ATLAS} ("resonant HH production at a mass of 1 TeV and corresponding to a local (global) significance of \SI{3.1}{\sigma} (\SI{2}{\sigma})"

+ The reduction of the sensitivity around $\mx = 280\,\si{\GeV}$ is a consequence of the shape of the tt background, that peaks about this value,

+ explain the observed trends in the limits (backgrounds, boosted taus)
+ mention the combination plots in [[fig:res_comb_xhh]]
  
* Pulls (maybe a different section??)
(copiado do Jona)
An important check to be performed is the control of the impact of the nuisance parameters on the result of the analysis by evaluating the so-called /pulls/ and /impacts/.
The pull is defined as the deviation of the value of $\hat{\theta}$ (ML estimator) with respect to its nominal value, divided by its uncertainty.
The impact is defined as the shift $\Delta\mu$ induced on the \ac{POI} when each nuisance is fixed to $\hat{\theta} \pm 1\,\sigma$, while all other nuisances are fixed to their maximum profiled likelihood estimate $\hat{\theta}$.
Show plot here if available.
