All systematic uncertainties should be assumed to have an impact on the shape of related distributions, and not simply on their rate.
However, if for a specific systematic source it is verified that shape modifications are negligible when compared to the expected sensitivity of the analysis, downgrading an uncertainty to be normalization-only has two important advantages.
The first relates to the much lower analysis complexity involved.
For each additional shape systematic, an extra set of variables representing the corresponding variations must be computed, processed and stored.
This is also valid for the inference step of the final discriminant, as long as the distributions being varied are used as a \ac{pDNN} input.
In that case, one must assess how much the input's changes affect the discriminant output, for each mass point and spin hypothesis.
The second advantage comes from the time taken to run the binned maximum likelihood fit.
A shape systematic is naturally more time-consuming, given that the binned distributions include more parameters than one single rate parameter.

The specific uncertainties are often centrally recommended, or are instead devised by the analysts themselves, and then approved by the Collaboration during the many review steps the work is subject to.
We list them in what follows:

+ *Luminosity*:
  The uncertainty on the luminosity measurement is estimated by the \ac{CMS} Lumi \ac{POG}.
  Different uncertainty sources are considered, and their correlations are reported in [[tab:LumiUnc]].
  These values are obtained from dedicated Van-der-Meer scans during data-taking.
  The uncertainties are applied to the signals and to all the background processes estimated from \ac{MC} simulation.
  The normalization of the \ac{QCD} background is obtained from data and hence not subject to luminosity uncertainties.

+ *Electron and muon isolation and identification efficiencies*:
  The uncertainties on electron and muon \ac{ID} and isolation efficiencies are determined from the uncertainties on the \acp{SF} describing data/\ac{MC} discrepancies.
  A value of 1% for both electrons and muons is obtained.

+ *QCD estimation uncertainty*:
  The \ac{QCD} background, which is estimated from data using the ABCD method, can be affected by different sources of systematics.
  We define three uncertainty sources:
  + *Shape*:
    Since the shape of the \ac{QCD} contribution can be estimated from two regions, B and C, a normalization uncertainty can be obtained by comparing the two shapes.
  + *Yield correction factor*:
    The statistical uncertainty on the B/D and C/D correction factors is defined as the sum in quadrature of the statistical uncertainties on the event yields in the concerned regions.
    The value of this uncertainty ranges from 5% to 100% depending on the category, channel and year considered.
  + *Additional term*:
    The first validation procedure described in [[#sec:multijet_bckg]] uses different =DeepTau= \acp{WP} to ensure that the multijet estimate does not depend on the $\tau$ isolation.
    In the few cases where a dependency is observed, an additional uncertainty is taken into account.
  [[tab:QCDUnc]] shows the \ac{QCD} normalization uncertainties for all years, channels and categories.
  The cell is empty if no \ac{QCD} could be estimated (as either regions B, C or D have negative yield).

+ *Final state branching fractions*:
  Two different normalization systematics are obtained by propagating the theoretical uncertainties on the Higgs decays to $\bbbar$ and $\tau\tau$, assuming $\mh=125\,\si{\GeV}$.
  We here list the values with their total uncertainties [[cite:&YellowReport4]]: $\mathcal{B}(\text{H} \rightarrow \text{bb}) = 0.5824 \pm ^{1.25\%}_{-1.27\%}$ and $\mathcal{B}(\text{H} \rightarrow \tau\tau) = 0.06272 \pm 1.65\%$.
  These uncertainties are included when converting the channel-specific upper limits to the inclusive \xhh{} process.

+ *Cross sections of simulated processes*:
  For $\ttbar$, W + jets, single top, single Higgs and multi-boson backgrounds, uncertainties due to the imperfect knowledge of the normalizations of the simulated processes are considered, with the values reported in [[tb:BackgroundTheoryUnc]].
