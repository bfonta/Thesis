We are finally able to condense all the work so far presented into quantifiable results.
They follow from a binned maximum likelihood fit of the analysis' final discriminant, including systematic uncertainties.
We show the results in [[#sec:final_limits]], and establish comparisons with related \ac{CMS} and \ac{ATLAS} results in [[#sec:results_comparison]].
