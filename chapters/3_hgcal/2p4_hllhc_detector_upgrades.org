For completeness, we here provide a brief overview of planned updates for other \ac{LHC} experiments, which will also have to handle the future high-radiation conditions:

+ *ATLAS*: In preparation for the increased \ac{LHC} luminosities, \ac{ATLAS} will feature a completely new \ac{IT}, extending its |\ac{eta}| coverage to 4, as well as the new \ac{HGTD}. The \ac{TRT} will be removed. The \ac{IT} will include \num{10} times more strips and \num{60} times more pixels, and its innermost layer will feature 3D \ac{Si} sensors, due to its superior radiation hardness [[cite:&3d_sensors_atlas]]. The \ac{HGTD} will reach resolutions of \SI{\sim 30}{\pico\second}, similar to the future \ac{CMS} \ac{MTD}. The trigger system will be fully refurbished, operating at \SI{\sim 1}{\mega\hertz}, and making decisions within \SI{\sim 10}{\micro\second}. The \ac{FE} and \ac{BE} of the calorimeters will be replaced to increase the granularity and handle the additional radiation [[cite:&wigmans_new_developments]]. The \ac{FE} will also be updated for the muon systems, which will be included for the first time in the \ac{ATLAS} trigger decision. A new \ac{RPC} layer will increase the muon trigger acceptance. Online luminosity measurements will be provided by the \ac{HGTD} and by the upgraded \ac{LUCID}. All these upgrades should be available from the start of the \ac{HL-LHC} [[cite:&atlas_hllhc]]. 
 
+ *LHCb*: Following the extremely significant \run{3} detector revamp, \ac{LHCb} is preparing a further upgrade for the \ac{HL-LHC} phase [[cite:&lhcb_hllhc_tdr;&lhcb_hllhc_interest]]. The current Shashlik \ac{EM} calorimeter is being replaced by a new "spaghetti calorimeter" with scintillating fibers and with high-performance modules and extra granularity, enabling timing measurements of \SI{\sim 20}{\pico\second}. The \acp{RICH} are also being upgraded with very fast electronics for single Cherenkov photons. The upgrades have already been successfully tested with \ac{SPS} beams.

- *ALICE*: Recent \run{3} upgrades included modifications to the Time Projection Chambers, \ac{IT}, \ac{MFT} and to the trigger. For \run{4}, an additional update to the \ac{IT} is foreseen, replacing its three innermost layers by ultra-thin layers placed closer to the \ac{IP} [[cite:&alice_its3_tdr]], together with the addition of new \ac{EM} and \ac{HAD} \acp{FoCal} [[cite:&alice_focal_tdr]]. The upgrades should further constrain gluon nuclear \acp{PDF}, besides providing increased resolutions and efficiencies.
  Additional upgrades are planned for \run{5}, after 2032. The exciting "near-massless" iris-shaped vertex tracker [[cite:&alice3_iris]] will sit at an inner radius of \SI{5}{\milli\meter} only, which requires a special retractable strategy to avoid damage from the unfocused \ac{LHC} beam! The vertices will be complemented by dedicated \ac{PID} \ac{TOF} detectors and an additional \ac{RICH} detector extending the charged high-$\pt$ \ac{PID}. Finally, muon detectors and the \ac{EM} calorimeter will also be updated.

+ *SHiP*: Starting from 2031, the new \ac{SHiP} experiment [[cite:&ship]] aims at searching for \ac{BSM} feebly interacting \acp{LLP} particles, which would be capable of explaining phenomena such as neutrino oscillations, dark matter, or the origin of the matter-antimatter asymmetry in the Universe. Examples of such particles are heavy neutral leptons, dark photons, dark scalars, axion-like particles, or light \ac{SUSY} particles. The experiment will use the high-intensity \ac{SPS} proton beam. Detectors will be away from the targets, in order to remove background noise and focus on \acp{LLP} only. Therefore, although not directly connected to the \ac{HL-LHC}, \ac{SHiP} will be sensitive to low mass particles, and will complement the upgraded detectors mentioned above.
