In this Section, we provide a very brief overview on the most up-to-date results obtained by the \ac{ATLAS} Collaboration on Higgs boson pair production.
A comparison with \ac{CMS} results can be made by looking at [[ref:sec:direct_searches,sec:indirect_searches]].
The channels covered by \ac{ATLAS} are virtually the same as covered by \ac{CMS}, but occasionally structured a bit differently: \hhbbbb{} resolved [[cite:&atlas_hh_bbbb_res]] and boosted [[cite:&atlas_hh_bbbb_boost]], \hhbbgg{} [[cite:&atlas_hh_bbgg]], \hhbbtt{} [[cite:&atlas_hh_bbtt]], \hhbbll{} [[cite:&atlas_hh_bbll]] and combined multi-leptonic decays [[cite:&atlas_hh_multileptons]].

Recent combined nonresonant results from the most sensitive searches with full \run{2} data are obtained.
In [[fig:limits_comb_atlas]], observed and expected 95% \ac{CL} upper limits on the \ac{ggF} (left) and \ac{VBF} (right) HH signal strength are depicted.
The three most sensitive channels are the silver bullets, \bbbb{}, \bbgg{} and \bbtt{}, as expected.
The \ac{ggF} combination leads to an observed (expected) limit on the HH cross section at 2.9 (2.4) the \ac{SM} expectation.
The \ac{VBF} combination is naturally much worse, the analysis being mostly used to constrain $\kvv$.
In [[fig:scan_comb_atlas]], the Higgs boson self-coupling modifier is constrained to the observed (expected) values of $−1.2 < \kl < 7.2$ ($−1.6 < \kl < 7.2$), while the coupling modifier between two Higgs bosons and two vector bosons is constrained to the observed (expected) values of $0.57 < \kvv < 1.48$ ($0.41 < \kvv < 1.65$).
The limits refer to a 95% \ac{CL}.
A two dimensional fit is shown in [[fig:kl_vs_k2v_atlas]] (left).
It is done in order to reduce model dependence, since the uni-dimensional fits are run by fixing all other coupling modifiers to their \ac{SM} values.
Finally, a \ac{HEFT} interpretation is performed for the three silver bullets, ignoring \ac{VBF} production, as shown in [[fig:kl_vs_k2v_atlas]] (right).
Constrains on various \ac{BSM} couplings can be inspected in \newcite{atlas_hh_comb}.

Resonant results are shown in [[fig:resonant_atlas]], were we can emphasize the small excess observed at $\mx=1\,\si{\TeV}$ for \bbtt{}, with a local (global) significance of \SI{3.1}{\sigma} (\SI{2.0}{\sigma}).
A statistical combination of the three silver bullets is also shown.
The other channels do not observe any tension.

#+CAPTION: Observed and expected 95% CL upper limits on the signal strength for the inclusive \ac{ggF} HH (left) and \ac{VBF} HH production (right), in the \bbtt{}, \bbgg{}, \bbbb{}, multi-lepton and \bbll{} decay channels, and their statistical combination. The \ac{ggF} or \ac{VBF} HH production cross section is fixed to the SM predicted value for $\mh=125\,\si{\GeV}$ when deriving limits on the corresponding signal strength. The expected limits, along with the $\pm1\sigma$ and $\pm2\sigma$ bands, are calculated under the assumption of no HH process, and with all nuisances profiled to the observed data.

#+CAPTION: Observed (solid lines) and expected (dashed lines) 95% CL exclusion limits on the HH production cross sections of the inclusive \ac{ggF} and \ac{VBF} processes as a function of $\kl$ (left) and the \ac{VBF} process as a function of $\kvv$ (right), for the \bbgg{} (purple), \bbtt{} (green), multi-lepton (cyan), \bbbb{} (blue) and \bbll{} (brown) decay channels and their combination (black). The expected limits assume no HH production or no \ac{VBF} HH production, respectively, for the left and right plots. In the right plot, the \ac{ggF} HH production cross section is assumed to be as predicted by the SM. The red line shows the theory prediction for the \ac{ggF} and \ac{VBF} HH production cross section as a function of $\kl$ (left), and the predicted \ac{VBF} HH cross section as a function of $\kvv$ (right). The bands surrounding the red cross section lines indicate the theoretical uncertainties on the predicted cross sections. Taken from [[cite:&atlas_hh_comb]].

#+CAPTION: (Left) Expected 95% CL contours in the $\kvv{}–\kl{}$ plane, corresponding to the individual decay channels and their combination, are illustrated using dashed lines. The observed contour from the combined results is depicted by a solid black line. The \ac{SM} prediction is marked by a star, and the combined best-fit value is indicated by a cross. (Right) Observed and expected 95% CL combined upper limits on the cross section for the \ac{SM} and seven \ac{BSM} \ac{HEFT} benchmarks in the ggF process, describing representative signal kinematics and $\mhh$ shape features obtained by varying multiple \ac{HEFT} coefficients. The expected limits from the \bbtt{}, \bbgg{} and \bbbb{} decay channels are presented as well. Theoretical predictions, estimated using specific sets of coefficient values defined in the benchmarks, are shown as red cross dots. Taken from [[cite:&atlas_hh_comb]].
