On top of the HH searches already mentioned, $\kl$ can be additionally constrained by exploiting \ac{NLO} \ac{EW} corrections to single Higgs processes, which also depend on $\kl$.
Single Higgs cross-sections can indeed be quite sensitive to $\kl$ variations, especially in the VH and ttH production modes, where up to 10% differences are expected.
Additionally, there is a strong complementarity between direct and indirect searches.
HH searches generally provide weaker contraints on the Higgs boson coupling to fermions and vector bosons, due to the lower production cross-section with respect to single Higgs.
On the other hand, double Higgs processes provide stronger constraints on $\kl$.

The main challenge of the combination recently performed by \ac{CMS} [[cite:&CMSHplusHHcomb]] consists on estimating and efficiently removing overlaps between signal regions of different analysis.
The mitigation of double-counting and minimization of overlaps, together with the combination of event categories from both single and double-Higgs analysis, lead to stronger $\kl$ constraints.
The analysis with the most sensitive production modes are included.
Whenever overlaps exist, one of two approaches is taken: either additional selections are applied, or the least sensitive category or analysis is removed.
As an example, the \bbzz{} analysis is removed in favour of \zzfourl{} due to the former's relatively low sensitivity to $\kl$.
Concerning systematics, their modelling in HH processes is generally simpler when compared to single H, due to the limited statistics of HH.

\ac{CMS} observed exclusion intervals at 95% \ac{CL} of $-0.4 < \kl < 6.3$, assuming other Higgs couplings to follow the \ac{SM}, or $-1.4 < k_{\lambda} < 6.1$ otherwise.
For comparison, \ac{ATLAS} observed $-0.4 < \kl < 6.3$, assuming \ac{SM} couplings, or $-1.4 < k_{\lambda} < 6.1$ otherwise [[cite:&ATLASHplusHHcomb]].
We show ($\kl$, $\kt$) and ($\kv$, $\kvv$) scans in [[fig:combination_2d_scans]], where the complementarity between the two types of processes is clearly highlighted.
\ac{CMS} was also able to once again [[cite:&higgs_10_years]] exclude $\kvv=0$ at more than 5\sigma, this time without fixing $\kv=1$.

The strong complementarity between the single and double Higgs processes is well illustrated. The remaining coupling modifiers are set to their \ac{SM} value. Taken from [[cite:&CMSHplusHHcomb]].
