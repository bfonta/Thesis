\begin{abstract}
\noindent The production of Higgs boson pairs (HH) at the LHC is the main handle for the measurement of the Higgs boson interaction with itself and is thus a fundamental test of the Standard Model theory as well as for determining the Higgs potential.
The most recent results from the CMS collaboration on measurements of non-resonant HH production using different final states and their combination using the data set collected by the CMS experiment at a centre of mass energy of 13 TeV will be presented.
