PhD thesis with Emacs org-mode.

To obtain the Thesis manuscript named ~thesis.pdf~, one must run =M-x org-latex-export-to-pdf= or similar within an Emacs session.
The commands first exports the ~.org~ files into =LaTeX=, and then launches a standard =pdflatex= command, or similar, to generate a PDF.
For more information, run =C-h f org-latex-export-to-pdf= within an Emacs session.

*** Notes
+ The bibliographic file =unsrt.bst= was modified following the approach detailed [[https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/26575/bibtex-how-to-reduce-long-author-lists-to-firstauthor-et-al][here]], and named ~thesis_custom.bst~. The modification limits the number of displayed authors to 4.
+ Due to issues with the integration of the official University scripts for the cover and back with the ~mimosis~ class, those pages are produced separately and merged after the Thesis has been generated, using ~bash scripts/merge_pdfs.sh~, which creates a file named ~thesis_final.pdf~.
  The ~thesis.pdf~ file does have a cover and a back, but they do not exhibit the correct format.
