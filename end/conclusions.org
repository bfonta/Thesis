The work presented in this Thesis covered some of the central axes of Experimental Particle Physics.
By exploiting current and future capabilities of the \ac{CMS} detector at CERN's \ac{LHC}, we provided original contributions to the field, on a range of topics.
New algorithms were developed within a custom software framework, in the context of the future \ac{HGCAL}.
\Ac{CMS} \run{2} datasets were analyzed to search for the resonant production of a Higgs bosons pairs.
A simulation study was for the first time performed, in order to probe the impact that resonance effects have on the upper limits extracted for \ac{NP} models.
The above subjects are all linked, by the need and the wish to provide measurements of ever increasing precision, which might one day lead to the next revolution.

+ hgcal:
  + promising algorithms for tp reconstruction
  + framework for the future including geometry; already used by other students

+ analysis:
  + In particular, we are almost a factor of 2 more sensitive at \SI{1}{\TeV}, and can thus conclude that the analysis should be able to confirm or reject the tension observed by \ac{ATLAS}.
  + best sensitivity ever for \xhhbbtt{}, driving sensitivity for \ac{CMS} combination at $450 \leq \mx \leq 800 \,\si{\GeV}$ range
  + improvement much above naive lumi scaling
  + CMS HL-LHC projection wiill improve with our result

For most of the studied mass points, sizable interference ratios occur only in parameter regions to which the current measurements are not yet sensitive, or at too large values of sin α.
In particular, for large resonance masses, with mX above 600 GeV, where interference effects tend to grow, measurements are far below the current sensitivity and might only play a role when the full data set from the HL-LHC becomes available.
However, there are regions at intermediate mX where the interpretation of NWA-based limits for HH derived in the singlet model would solicit some care already in the Run 2 combination (for example mX = 500 GeV, sin α = 0.2 and λHHX = 400 GeV).
It is important to note that such interpretations are generally model dependent.

Still, the signature develops a peak-dip structure for a negative interference ratio, and a shoulder-like enhancement towards large masses for a positive interference ratio. 
For a precision measurement, which is not yet in our reach, a distortion of the signal shape would have to be taken into account.

conclude on the impact of the NWA
The study had to make a reasonable choice of parameter thresholds. Notwidthstanding, the study represents the first dedicated interference study within CMS,
hinting already at the necessity of avoiding the NWA in future HH analyses.

projections, where we clearly show that the \ac{HL-LHC} will dramatically expand the exclusion region of the singlet model.
Intereference effects will be become more and more significant.

After the discovery of the Higgs boson particle, the first ten years of experimental measurements of this particle and searches for
other such scalar particles has revolutionized the field of particle physics.
Regardless of theory, the Higgs boson remains a singular particle that exhibits couplings to both fermions and bosons as long as they have mass.
To date, all its properties remain compatible with those predicted by the Standard Model of particle physics.
This does not mean that the Higgs boson particle is the SM Higgs boson; it only reflects the fact that more precise measurements
of the Higgs boson and new, different, Higgs boson measurements are needed, as it is a promising gateway to phenomena beyond the
Standard Model.
The great strides made in one decade of experimental physics with the Higgs boson particle would not have been possible without continued improvements and upgrades to the detectors, be it their tracking systems, their trigger systems, or the calibration and reconstruction software algorithms.
These have enabled us to peer into the interaction of the Higgs boson particle with second generation particles and produce spectacular results coming from the study of the production of Higgs boson pairs.
The Higgs boson particle is a new tool in the toolbox of fundamental physics.
While it remains the sole representative of what could be a host of scalar particles, the Higgs boson particle has been seen to have a broad reach and the coming decades and future accelerators are needed to understand its role in nature and whether it can provide hints for a theory that overcomes the shortcoming of the Standard Model, perhaps through a
global interpretation in the framework of an effective field theory that can capture deviations from large classes of concrete
alternatives to the Standard Model.
Experimentalists and theorists alike stand ready to take on the challenge.
They only require the resources to produce large numbers of Higgs bosons, detect them, and analyze and interpret those data.
