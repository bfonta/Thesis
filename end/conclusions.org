# Intro
The work presented in this Thesis covers some of the central axes of Experimental Particle Physics.
By exploiting the current and future capabilities of the \ac{CMS} detector at CERN's \ac{LHC}, original findings have been provided to the field, across a range of topics.
The contributions span developments for the reconstruction of Trigger Primitives in the future High Granularity Calorimeter (HGCAL), and studies related to the production of Higgs boson pairs.
The latter is approached from the perspective of a physics analysis, through the resonant production of the \bbtt{} final state, and from a phenomenological angle, by investigating the impact of removing the Narrow Width Approximation from HH interpretations, namely on double Higgs production cross section upper limits.

# HGCAL
The upcoming High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) phase promises to bring a ten-fold increase in the integrated luminosity delivered to the experiments, with a center-of-mass energy of \SI{14}{\TeV}.
This additional data will strongly benefit the sensitivity of physics measurements, especially for rare processes, which in turn leads to more precise theoretical calculations.
However, the HL-LHC also brings major challenges.
The expected huge increase of radiation levels requires the complete hardware refurbishment of many \ac{CMS} detectors, especially when located close to the beamline.
Large upgrades are furthermore required in the triggering and reconstruction of physics objects, in order to sustain the tremendous data rates to be processed, and to disentangle the \num{\sim 200} pile-up proton interactions at each bunch-crossing.
In particular, the HGCAL is bound to become a flagship detector for \ac{CMS}.
It will bring impressive spatial and timing resolutions, within a lateral and longitudinal granularity never before seen in a High Energy Physics experiment.
The successful reconstruction in such a crowded environment starts from an effective trigger strategy, in which Trigger Primitives play a major role.
This Thesis proposed new algorithms for the reconstruction of Trigger Primitives, focusing on the mitigation of cluster splits during the clustering reconstruction stage.
Such a task was achieved through a software framework which was developed from scratch, includes a simplified version of HGCAL's geometry, and serves as a basis for further studies.
The algorithms have the potential to be implemented in the firmware, and improve HGCAL's capabilities.
Importantly, cluster splitting is shown to be almost fully removed, using techniques that will not require additional firmware resources.

# bbtt
On the physics analysis side, \ac{CMS} is strongly engaged on studying the production of Higgs boson pairs, exploiting both nonresonant and resonant processes as a gateway to New Physics.
These studies are deeply motivated by the intrinsic structure of the Standard Model (SM) of Particle Physics, which contains a yet unmeasured coupling of the Higgs boson with itself, and by a wide range of Beyond the SM (BSM) frameworks, where new particles couple to the Higgs sector and can profoundly alter the understanding of fundamental particle interactions.
In this work, a search for the resonant production of a pair of Higgs bosons decaying into a pair of b quarks and a pair of $\tau$ leptons is performed, using \ac{CMS} \run{2} data collected at \SI{13}{\TeV}.
95% \ac{CL} upper limits on the production cross section of \spin{0} and \spin{2} BSM particles are computed, for masses from \SI{250}{\GeV} to \SI{3}{\TeV}.
When comparing the expected limits obtained to the first 2016-only \ac{CMS} results, an improvement much larger than a simple luminosity scaling is observed.
The performance increase comes from updated samples, an extended trigger strategy and analysis phase-space, the optimization of many selection stages, and the development and implementation of powerful discriminants.
This work provides the tightest limits ever obtained in the \bbtt{} channel for most of the scanned mass range, and demonstrates that this channel will drive \ac{CMS}' sensitivity at intermediate mass values.
The results should thus be included in a future \xhh{} combination.
Moreover, for some mass points, the \run{2} results reach and surpass the most recent projection of \xhhbbtt{} results for the HL-LHC.
The techniques employed in the analysis are already serving as a starting point for future \bbtt{} studies, which will further test the consistency of the SM and beyond.

# interferences
The above resonant analysis was complemented by a phenomenological study, which probed the impact that resonance effects have on HH cross section upper limits.
For the first time in \ac{CMS}, the Narrow Width Approximation was not used, in order to assess interference effects between \ac{BSM} particles decaying to a Higgs boson pair, and the continuous \ac{SM} HH background.
The study is performed using the singlet model.
For most of the studied mass points, the effects are sizable only in parameter regions to which current measurements are not yet sensitive.
However, there are regions at intermediate $\mx$ values where the interpretation of NWA-based limits requires some care already in the \run{2} combination.
Such concerns will definitely play a role when the full HL-LHC dataset becomes available.
Additionally,  clear distortions in the $\mhh$ lineshapes are observed, which will have to be taken into account as soon as HH processes can be precisely measured.
It is important to note that such interpretations are generally model dependent, and that a reasonable choice of parameter thresholds had to be made.
Notwithstanding such limitations, the study hints at the necessity of avoiding the NWA in future HH analyses.
Finally, this Thesis provides the most recent projections of singlet model upper limits, for a variety of resonance masses, to HL-LHC luminosity values.

# wrap-up
I conclude this Thesis by expressing my sincere wish that the contributions here discussed will, first and foremost, be useful, and that might hopefully provide a modest basis for the next groundbreaking discovery we all wish to witness.
